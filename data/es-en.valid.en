When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to B@@ BC Ne@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay radio .
There was a big s@@ mile on his face which was un@@ usual then , because the news mostly depres@@ sed him .
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ ban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ ban took over Afghanistan and made it il@@ legal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dres@@ sed as a boy to es@@ cor@@ t my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
Each day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would sus@@ p@@ ect where we were going .
We would cover our books in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ags so it would seem we were just out sho@@ pping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us pac@@ ked in one small living room .
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ ban were sus@@ pi@@ cious .
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and dau@@ gh@@ ters were tre@@ asu@@ red .
My grand@@ father was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total ma@@ ver@@ ick from a remote pro@@ vin@@ ce of Afghanistan , he in@@ sist@@ ed that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father .
But my educ@@ ated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She reti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to recei@@ ve an education .
There was no question that his children would recei@@ ve an education , including his dau@@ gh@@ ters , despite the T@@ ali@@ ban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educ@@ ating his children .
Dur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ ban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustr@@ ated by our life and always being scar@@ ed and not seeing a future .
I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ isten , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always re@@ main with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destro@@ yed by decades of war .
F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so commit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mid@@ d@@ le@@ bur@@ y Col@@ le@@ ge .
( Applause ) When I re@@ turned to Afghanistan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his dau@@ gh@@ ters , was among the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me .
He not only br@@ ags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of K@@ abu@@ l .
( Applause ) My family believ@@ es in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ s@@ ador for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educ@@ ate women .
That &apos;s why I co@@ foun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion grab@@ bing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ voc@@ ate for them , despite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position .
Like Ah@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ah@@ med is the father of one of my students .
L@@ ess than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they literally mis@@ sed being killed by a ro@@ ad@@ side bo@@ mb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone ran@@ g , a voice war@@ ning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the West , that behind most of us who succe@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ zes the value in his daughter and who se@@ es that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initi@@ al and convinc@@ ing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their dau@@ gh@@ ters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ ban , girls who went to school nu@@ m@@ ber@@ ed in the hundreds — remember , it was il@@ legal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the frag@@ ili@@ ty in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ voc@@ ate for them , who encour@@ age them , I see a promis@@ ing future and l@@ asting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that .
Like me , they are dre@@ aming big .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the white have separ@@ ated .
And slightly more complex things appear .
That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
And deep ben@@ e@@ ath those oceans , at cr@@ acks in the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , you &apos;ve got heat se@@ eping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
But of course , life is more than just ex@@ o@@ tic chemistry .
Hu@@ man beings start putting each other into bo@@ xes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they at@@ trac@@ tive ?
Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential net@@ working opportunity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we meet people to make a mental resu@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been di@@ vor@@ ced ?
Does your bre@@ ath smell bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neuro@@ log@@ ically har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to see@@ k out people like ourselves .
We start form@@ ing cli@@ ques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what accep@@ tan@@ ce feels like .
We b@@ ond together based on anything that we can — music prefer@@ ence , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
We see@@ k out environ@@ ments that re@@ infor@@ ce our personal choices .
Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to s@@ que@@ e@@ ze yourself inside of it .
Because the categ@@ ories , I &apos;ve found , are too limit@@ ing .
The bo@@ xes are too n@@ arro@@ w .
And this can get really dangerous .
So here &apos;s a dis@@ cl@@ a@@ imer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
I grew up in a very shel@@ tered environment .
I was raised in down@@ town Manhattan in the early 198@@ 0s , two blocks from the ep@@ ic@@ enter of pun@@ k music .
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of big@@ otr@@ y and the social restric@@ tions of a religi@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ based up@@ bringing .
Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a dra@@ g que@@ en or a radical thin@@ ker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do .
( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x up@@ bringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
So I went home , and I sha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
I kept up the char@@ ade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was playing a kid named Wal@@ ter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Ju@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christi@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ ger@@ ed him .
See , I was also a child actor , which dou@@ bled up the lay@@ ers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with .
Ki@@ ds would often come up to me in class and gra@@ b me by the thro@@ at to check for an A@@ dam &apos;s ap@@ ple or gra@@ b my cr@@ ot@@ ch to check what I was working with .
When I would go to the ba@@ th@@ room , I would turn my shoes around in the st@@ alls so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing standing up .
At sle@@ e@@ po@@ vers I would have p@@ anic att@@ acks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s worth menti@@ oning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my gen@@ it@@ alia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was perform@@ ing this elabor@@ ate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fied as trans@@ gender .
If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnos@@ ed me as something like gender dy@@ s@@ mor@@ phi@@ c and put me on hor@@ m@@ ones to st@@ ave off pu@@ ber@@ ty .
But in my particular case , I just wo@@ ke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
Pu@@ ber@@ ty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
When a kid beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
No one is exactly sho@@ c@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fall@@ en in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discu@@ ss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents bat@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ ash either .
See , it &apos;s one of the great bl@@ ess@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ position 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was rais@@ ing a lot of d@@ ust around this country .
And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
But I was struc@@ k by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ n@@ ished civil rights record , could be repe@@ ating its mist@@ akes so bl@@ at@@ antly .
And I remember watching the discus@@ sion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separ@@ ation of ch@@ urch and state was essentially drawing ge@@ ograph@@ ical bo@@ und@@ aries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
And then , that this discus@@ sion was drawing ge@@ ograph@@ ical bo@@ und@@ aries around me .
If this was a war with two dispar@@ ate sides , I , by def@@ aul@@ t , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
At the time I was just beginning to emer@@ ge from this ei@@ ght-@@ year personal identity crisis z@@ ig@@ z@@ a@@ g that saw me go from being a boy to being this aw@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clo@@ th@@ es to the opposite extreme of this sup@@ er sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ com@@ pens@@ ating , bo@@ y-@@ cha@@ sing gir@@ l@@ y-@@ girl to finally just a h@@ esit@@ ant explor@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ bo@@ y@@ ish girl who li@@ ked both boys and girls depen@@ ding on the person .
I had spent a year photograph@@ ing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of be@@ tw@@ e@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lines — girls who sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ acy under@@ wear , girls who had boys &apos; ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts but wor@@ e gir@@ ly n@@ ail poli@@ sh , girls who had ey@@ es@@ ha@@ dow to match their scr@@ ap@@ ed kne@@ es , girls who li@@ ked girls and boys who all li@@ ked boys and girls who all ha@@ ted being bo@@ xed in to anything .
I loved these people , and I admi@@ red their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our u@@ topi@@ an bu@@ bble explo@@ ded into these r@@ aging deb@@ ates where pun@@ di@@ ts started lik@@ ening our love to b@@ esti@@ ality on national television .
And this powerful awar@@ eness ro@@ lled in over me that I was a min@@ ority , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my character .
I was leg@@ ally and in@@ dis@@ pu@@ tab@@ ly a secon@@ d-@@ class citiz@@ en .
I was not an activi@@ st .
I wave no fl@@ ags in my own life .
But I was pla@@ gu@@ ed by this question : How could anyone vote to stri@@ p the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one el@@ ement of their character ?
How could they say that we as a group were not deser@@ ving of equal rights as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consci@@ ously met a victi@@ m of their dis@@ crimin@@ ation ?
Did they know who they were vot@@ ing against and what the impact was ?
And then it occur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were c@@ asting into secon@@ d-@@ class citiz@@ ens@@ hi@@ p it might make it harder for them to do .
It might give them p@@ ause .
Obvi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photograph@@ ically without any arti@@ fic@@ e , without any ligh@@ ting , or without any manipul@@ ation of any kind on my part .
Because in a photograph you can exam@@ ine a li@@ on &apos;s wh@@ is@@ kers without the fear of him ri@@ pping your face off .
For me , photograph@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing film , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vie@@ wer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
Life magazine introduc@@ ed generations of people to dist@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew exist@@ ed through pictures .
So I decided to make a series of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will .
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limit@@ less number of people .
( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help .
So I ran out in the fre@@ ez@@ ing cold , and I photograph@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ ebr@@ uary of about two years ago .
And I took those photograph@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help .
And they fun@@ ded two weeks of sho@@ oting in New York .
And then we made this .
( Music ) Video : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ let@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ d@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photograp@@ hic record of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .
My aim is to take a simple por@@ tra@@ it of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q spectrum in any way .
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simpli@@ city of a face .
( Music ) &quot; We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evid@@ ent that all men are created equal . &quot;
It &apos;s written in the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depend@@ ence .
We are fail@@ ing as a nation to up@@ hold the mor@@ als upon which we were foun@@ ded .
There is no equality in the United States .
&#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ri@@ age &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Fre@@ e@@ dom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ re@@ at every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can leg@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your sex@@ u@@ ality .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the gener@@ ous support of the Hu@@ man Ri@@ ghts Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n .
I want to take the project across the country .
I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to sho@@ ot 4@@ ,000 or 5,000 people .
This is my contribu@@ tion to the civil rights fight of my generation .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deser@@ ve less than any other human being .
( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ el@@ f evid@@ ent tru@@ ths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4@@ ,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) i@@ O T@@ il@@ let@@ t W@@ right : Ab@@ solu@@ tely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
Al@@ most 8@@ 5,000 people watched that video , and then they started em@@ ail@@ ing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their faces .
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticip@@ ated .
So I changed my immedi@@ ate goal to 10,000 faces .
That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have travel@@ ed to almost 20 cities and photograph@@ ed almost 2,000 people .
I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just qui@@ et and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
So after travel@@ ing and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ ho@@ ma or small@@ -@@ town Texas , we found evidence that the initi@@ al premi@@ se was dead on .
Vi@@ sibility really is key .
F@@ ami@@ li@@ ar@@ ity really is the g@@ ate@@ way drug to empa@@ thy .
Once an issue po@@ ps up in your own back@@ y@@ ard or am@@ ong@@ st your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sym@@ pa@@ thy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
Of course , in my trav@@ els I met people who leg@@ ally di@@ vor@@ ced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Sou@@ thern B@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts who swit@@ ched ch@@ ur@@ ches because their child was a les@@ bi@@ an .
S@@ par@@ king empa@@ thy had become the back@@ bone of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ d@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ d@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differences between us .
In fact , on the contr@@ ary , it high@@ lights them .
It pres@@ ents , not just the compl@@ exi@@ ties found in a proces@@ sion of different human beings , but the compl@@ exi@@ ties found within each individual person .
It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ xes , it was that we had too few .
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; g@@ ays &quot; &quot; was inher@@ ently fla@@ wed , because there were a million different sha@@ des of gay .
Here I was trying to help , and I had perpe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
At some point I ad@@ ded a question to the release form that asked people to qu@@ anti@@ fy themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
And I watched so many exist@@ ential cri@@ ses un@@ fold in front of me .
( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been present@@ ed with the op@@ tion before .
Can you qu@@ anti@@ fy your open@@ ness ?
Once they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks .
Of course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger propor@@ tion of people identi@@ fied as something that was much more nu@@ anced .
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to re@@ fer to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that prefer@@ ence doesn &apos;t exist .
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orient@@ ation is a choice , I invi@@ te you to go out and try to be gre@@ y .
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-@@ dimensional .
The most important thing to take from the perc@@ ent@@ age system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one bin@@ ary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
And the reality that this pres@@ ents is a complicated one .
Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a bos@@ s to fire an employ@@ ee for homo@@ sexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two he@@ ter@@ o@@ sexual experiences so far ?
Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homo@@ sexual experiences th@@ us far ?
Where exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ class citiz@@ en ?
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my trav@@ els is just what a poor bin@@ ding ag@@ ent sexual orient@@ ation is .
After travel@@ ing so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jer@@ ks and s@@ wee@@ the@@ arts and Dem@@ ocr@@ ats and Re@@ public@@ ans and j@@ oc@@ ks and que@@ ens and every other pol@@ ariz@@ ation you can possibly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human race .
A@@ side from the fact that we play with one legal hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the shared narrative of pre@@ judi@@ ce and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
So in the end@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of faces that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ d@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths is always becoming , as it hopefully appe@@ ars across more and more plat@@ forms , bus shel@@ ters , bill@@ bo@@ ards , Facebook pages , screen sa@@ vers , perhaps in watching this proces@@ sion of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
Ho@@ pe@@ fully these categ@@ ories , these bin@@ aries , these over@@ -@@ simpli@@ fied bo@@ xes will begin to become us@@ eless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
What we see are human beings in all their multi@@ pli@@ city .
And seeing them makes it harder to den@@ y their humanity .
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to den@@ y their human rights .
So is it me particularly that you would choose to den@@ y the right to hou@@ sing , the right to adop@@ t children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
A@@ m I the one that you choose to di@@ so@@ wn as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighb@@ or , your cou@@ sin , your un@@ cle , the president , your police woman or the fi@@ re@@ man ?
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
So please don &apos;t gre@@ et us as str@@ angers , gre@@ et us as your fellow human beings , period .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m 150 feet down an il@@ legal mine sha@@ ft in Ghana .
The air is th@@ ick with heat and d@@ ust , and it &apos;s hard to brea@@ the .
I can feel the br@@ ush of swe@@ at@@ y bodies pas@@ sing me in the dar@@ k@@ ness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the sha@@ ft is this ca@@ co@@ ph@@ ony of men cou@@ gh@@ ing , and stone being broken with primi@@ tive tools .
Like the others , I wear a f@@ lic@@ k@@ ering , cheap fl@@ ash@@ light ti@@ ed to my head with this el@@ astic , tat@@ tered band , and I can bar@@ ely make out the s@@ lic@@ k tree li@@ mb@@ s holding up the walls of the three-@@ foot square hole dro@@ pping hundreds of feet into the earth .
When my hand sli@@ ps , I suddenly remember a min@@ er I had met days before who had lost his gri@@ p and fell coun@@ t@@ less feet down that sha@@ ft .
As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , ris@@ king their lives without pay@@ ment or com@@ pens@@ ation , and often dying .
I got to cli@@ mb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re tr@@ apped in s@@ la@@ very .
For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been document@@ ing indi@@ gen@@ ous cul@@ tures in more than 70 countries on six contin@@ ents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the so@@ le exhi@@ bit@@ or at the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver Pe@@ ace Su@@ m@@ mit .
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the ast@@ on@@ ishing people I met there , I met a sup@@ por@@ ter of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , an N@@ G@@ O dedic@@ ated to er@@ adic@@ ating modern day s@@ la@@ very .
We started talking about s@@ la@@ very , and really , I started learning about s@@ la@@ very , for I had certainly known it exist@@ ed in the world , but not to such a degree .
After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and hon@@ est@@ ly as@@ ha@@ med at my own lack of knowledge of this atr@@ o@@ city in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
It started bur@@ ning a hole in my st@@ om@@ ach , so within weeks , I fle@@ w down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves and offer them my help .
Th@@ us began my journey into modern day s@@ la@@ very .
O@@ d@@ dly , I had been to many of these places before .
Some I even considered like my second home .
But this time , I would see the skelet@@ ons hidden in the clo@@ set .
A conserv@@ ative esti@@ mate tells us there are more than 27 million people ens@@ lav@@ ed in the world today .
That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ At@@ lan@@ tic sl@@ ave trade .
A hundred and fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , an agricul@@ tural sl@@ ave cost about three times the an@@ nu@@ al sal@@ ary of an American wor@@ ker .
That equ@@ ates to about $ 5@@ 0,000 in today &apos;s money .
Yet today , entire families can be ens@@ lav@@ ed for generations over a deb@@ t as small as $ 18 .
A@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , s@@ la@@ very gener@@ ates prof@@ its of more than $ 13 billion world@@ wide each year .
Many have been tr@@ ic@@ ked by fal@@ se promis@@ es of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Today &apos;s s@@ la@@ very is about commer@@ ce , so the go@@ ods that ens@@ lav@@ ed people produce have value , but the people producing them are dis@@ pos@@ able .
S@@ la@@ very exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ legal everywhere in the world .
In India and N@@ ep@@ al , I was introduc@@ ed to the br@@ ick kil@@ ns .
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egyp@@ t or D@@ ante &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
En@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in temper@@ atures of 1@@ 30 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were clo@@ a@@ ked in a heavy blan@@ ket of d@@ ust , while mechan@@ ically st@@ ac@@ king br@@ icks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carr@@ ying them from the s@@ cor@@ ching kil@@ ns to truc@@ ks hundreds of y@@ ards away .
De@@ ad@@ en@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ ony and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
There were no brea@@ ks for food , no water brea@@ ks , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ consequ@@ ential .
So per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve was the heat and the d@@ ust that my camera became too hot to even touch and c@@ eas@@ ed working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cru@@ is@@ er to clean out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
B@@ ack in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to cr@@ y , but the abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly grab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly expla@@ ined to me that emotional dis@@ plays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citiz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves to work within the system for their liber@@ ation , and I tr@@ usted that they would .
As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ break .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , I found children carr@@ ying stone for miles down moun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ rain to truc@@ ks waiting at roads below .
The big she@@ ets of s@@ late were he@@ avi@@ er than the children carr@@ ying them , and the kids ho@@ ist@@ ed them from their heads using these hand@@ made har@@ n@@ esses of stic@@ ks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ oth .
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
How can we affect something so insi@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve ?
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re ens@@ lav@@ ed , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
They have nothing to compare it to .
When these vill@@ agers cl@@ aim@@ ed their freedom , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ists on the ground helped them get a qu@@ arry le@@ ase of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ bre@@ aking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Se@@ x traf@@ fic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word s@@ la@@ very , and because of this world@@ wide awar@@ eness , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work saf@@ ely within this particular industry .
In K@@ ath@@ man@@ d@@ u , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had previ@@ ously been sex sl@@ aves themselves .
They us@@ her@@ ed me down a n@@ arro@@ w set of st@@ airs that led to this dir@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ent lit bas@@ ement .
This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ th@@ el , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
C@@ ab@@ in restaur@@ ants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are ven@@ u@@ es for forced pro@@ stitu@@ tion .
Each has small , private rooms , where the sl@@ aves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to enter@@ tain the cli@@ ents , encour@@ aging them to buy more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
Each cu@@ bic@@ le is dark and d@@ ing@@ y , identi@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the wall , and parti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ ywood and a cur@@ tain .
The workers here often en@@ dur@@ e trag@@ ic sexual ab@@ use at the hands of their cust@@ omers .
St@@ anding in the near dar@@ k@@ ness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ apped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the st@@ airs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ dows large enough to cli@@ mb through .
These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that s@@ la@@ very , including sex traf@@ fic@@ king , occur@@ s in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well .
Ten@@ s of hundreds of people are ens@@ lav@@ ed in agriculture , in restaur@@ ants , in dom@@ esti@@ c serv@@ itu@@ de , and the list can go on .
R@@ ec@@ ently , the New York Times report@@ ed that between 100,000 and 3@@ 00,000 American children are sold into sex s@@ la@@ very every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The tex@@ ti@@ le industry is another one we often think of when we hear about sl@@ ave labor .
I visi@@ ted vill@@ ages in India where entire families were ens@@ lav@@ ed in the sil@@ k trade .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
The dy@@ ed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
They mix d@@ ye in these big bar@@ rel@@ s , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ quid up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ ye is toxi@@ c .
My interpre@@ ter told me their stories .
&quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get paid for our dy@@ e@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s esti@@ mat@@ ed that more than 4@@ ,000 children are ens@@ lav@@ ed on L@@ ake Vol@@ ta , the largest man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fish@@ ing on a boat , two older bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all ens@@ lav@@ ed .
Chi@@ l@@ dren are taken from their families and traf@@ fic@@ ked and van@@ ished , and they &apos;re forced to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to swi@@ m .
This young child is eight years old .
He was tre@@ m@@ bling when our boat appro@@ ached , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e .
He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .
The skelet@@ al tree li@@ mb@@ s sub@@ mer@@ ged in L@@ ake Vol@@ ta often catch the fish@@ ing ne@@ ts , and w@@ ear@@ y , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed children are thro@@ wn into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lines .
Many of them dro@@ wn .
For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been forced to work on the la@@ ke .
T@@ erri@@ fied of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger sl@@ aves that he man@@ ages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were ha@@ ul@@ ing in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m.
in the cold , win@@ dy night .
And it &apos;s important to note that these ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a fish@@ ing village .
I met him at a shel@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves re@@ ha@@ bili@@ t@@ ates victims of s@@ la@@ very .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a b@@ ath at the well , po@@ uring big bu@@ ck@@ ets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been reun@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possibility .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
D@@ ri@@ ving down a road in Ghana with part@@ ners of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , a fellow abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a mo@@ ped suddenly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ is@@ er and tap@@ ped on the window .
He told us to follow him down a dir@@ t road into the jun@@ g@@ le .
At the end of the road , he ur@@ ged us out of the car , and told the dri@@ ver to quickly leave .
Then he pointed toward this bar@@ ely visible foot@@ path , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we push@@ ed asi@@ de the v@@ ines bloc@@ king the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the tr@@ ail had become f@@ loo@@ ded by recent ra@@ ins , so I ho@@ ist@@ ed the photo ge@@ ar above my head as we descen@@ ded into these wat@@ ers up to my ch@@ est .
After another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tr@@ ail ab@@ rup@@ tly ended at a clear@@ ing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a foot@@ ball field , and all of them were full of ens@@ lav@@ ed people labor@@ ing .
Many women had children str@@ apped to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for gold , w@@ ading in water po@@ is@@ oned by mer@@ cur@@ y .
M@@ er@@ cur@@ y is used in the extr@@ action process .
These min@@ ers are ens@@ lav@@ ed in a mine sha@@ ft in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the sha@@ ft , they were so@@ aking w@@ et from their own swe@@ at .
I remember looking into their ti@@ red , bloo@@ d@@ shot eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 7@@ 2 hours .
The sha@@ f@@ ts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy b@@ ags of stone that later will be transport@@ ed to another area , where the stone will be po@@ unded so that they can extr@@ act the gold .
At first gl@@ ance , the po@@ un@@ ding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortun@@ ate working on the fr@@ ing@@ es , and children too .
All of them are victi@@ m to inj@@ ury , ill@@ ness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this mus@@ cular person will end up like this one here , r@@ acked with tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mer@@ cur@@ y po@@ is@@ oning in just a few years .
This is Man@@ ur@@ u . When his father died , his un@@ cle traf@@ fic@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es .
When his un@@ cle died , Man@@ ur@@ u inher@@ ited his un@@ cle &apos;s deb@@ t , which further forced him into being ens@@ lav@@ ed in the min@@ es .
When I met him , he had been working in the min@@ es for 14 years , and the leg inj@@ ury that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing accident , one so se@@ v@@ ere doctors say his leg should be am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated .
On top of that , Man@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine sha@@ ft .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educ@@ ated with the help of local activi@@ sts like F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , and it &apos;s this sort of determin@@ ation , in the face of uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able od@@ ds , that fi@@ lls me with complete a@@ we .
I want to sh@@ ine a light on s@@ la@@ very .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of c@@ and@@ les with me , and with the help of my interpre@@ ter , I im@@ par@@ ted to the people I was photograph@@ ing that I wanted to illu@@ min@@ ate their stories and their pli@@ ght , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ ar@@ ing wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to toler@@ ate atr@@ o@@ cities like s@@ la@@ very .
These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deser@@ ving of the same rights , dig@@ n@@ ity and respect in their lives .
There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mi@@ stre@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
I hope that these images aw@@ ak@@ en a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ig@@ ni@@ te a fire , and that fire will sh@@ ine a light on s@@ la@@ very , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ da@@ ge can continue to live in the sha@@ dows .
Thank you very much .

The de@@ cor@@ ative use of wi@@ re in sou@@ thern Africa dat@@ es back hundreds of years .
But moder@@ ni@@ z@@ ation actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of tel@@ eph@@ one wi@@ re .
R@@ ur@@ al to urban migr@@ ation meant that new@@ found industrial materials started to replace har@@ d-@@ to-@@ com@@ e-@@ by natural gras@@ ses .
So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contempor@@ ary materials .
These pieces date back from the &apos; 4@@ 0s to the late &apos; 5@@ 0s .
In the &apos; 9@@ 0s , my interest and passion for transi@@ tional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squ@@ at@@ ter cam@@ p outside Dur@@ ban .
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and ment@@ or@@ ing them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
And the project soon grew from five to 50 we@@ aver@@ s in about a year .
So@@ on we had out@@ grown the sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ards , what they could provide , so we co@@ er@@ ced a wi@@ re manu@@ f@@ actu@@ rer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bo@@ b@@ b@@ ins , but to produce to our color speci@@ fic@@ ations .
At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contempor@@ ary products , away from the eth@@ ni@@ c , a little bit more contempor@@ ary .
So I developed a whole range around — mas@@ s-@@ produced range — that obviously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er-@@ end de@@ co@@ r market that could be ex@@ port@@ ed and also service our local market .
We started experiment@@ ing , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Con@@ ran sho@@ ps , and Don@@ na K@@ aran , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
This is our group , our main group of we@@ aver@@ s .
They come on a wee@@ kly basis to Dur@@ ban .
They all have bank accoun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a wee@@ kly tur@@ n@@ around of production .
This is the community that I origin@@ ally showed you the slide of .
And that &apos;s also moder@@ ni@@ zed today , and it &apos;s sup@@ port@@ ing work for 300 we@@ aver@@ s .
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .

In an age of global stri@@ fe and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so dam@@ n good ?
If you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you know what I mean .
Here &apos;s why . B@@ ack in university , we had a quick project to design some so@@ lar@@ -@@ powered c@@ loc@@ ks .
Here &apos;s my clock .
It uses something called the d@@ war@@ f sun@@ flo@@ wer , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ches in he@@ ight .
Now , as you know , sun@@ f@@ lowers track the sun during the course of the day .
So in the morning , you see which direction the sun@@ flo@@ wer is facing , and you mark it on the bl@@ ank area in the base .
At no@@ on , you mark the changed position of the sun@@ flo@@ wer , and in the ev@@ ening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flo@@ wer .
So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ ased , subj@@ ective opini@@ on , it &apos;s brilliant .
However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s five mag@@ ni@@ fying gl@@ as@@ ses with a shot glass under each one .
In each shot glass is a different s@@ cent@@ ed oil .
In the morning , the sun@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first mag@@ ni@@ fying glass , focu@@ sing a be@@ am of light on the shot glass underneath .
This will warm up the s@@ cent@@ ed oil inside , and a particular smell will be em@@ it@@ ted .
So during the course of the day , five different sm@@ el@@ ls are disper@@ sed throughout that environment .
Any@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
You can see why I hate Chris .
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ g@@ ging me for well over a decade .
All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
Many years after the solar powered c@@ loc@@ ks project , a young lady I knew sugg@@ ested maybe sex is so good because of the five sens@@ es .
And when she said this , I had an epi@@ ph@@ any .
So I decided to evalu@@ ate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sens@@ es .
To do this , I de@@ vis@@ ed something called the five sens@@ es graph .
Al@@ ong the y-@@ ax@@ is , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ ax@@ is , you have , of course , the five sens@@ es .
Any@@ time I had a mem@@ or@@ able experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five sens@@ es di@@ ary .
Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
Bi@@ ke designer : This is &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , cust@@ om bi@@ ke designer .
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; Si@@ ght &#93; &#91; S@@ m@@ ell &#93; &#91; T@@ aste &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sens@@ es graph works .
So here are some other results .
The first is for inst@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
Now obviously , tas@@ te and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people .
OK , next , clu@@ b@@ bing .
These people I still do han@@ g out with .
All right , and smo@@ king .
Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smo@@ kers told me the sens@@ ation of holding a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te and bringing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the smo@@ king experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scar@@ y to think how well ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes are designed by the manufactur@@ ers .
OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five sens@@ es graph ?
It would , of course , be a horizon@@ tal line along the top .
Now you can see , not even as inten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes close .
In fact , in the years that I gather@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
Res@@ pon@@ d@@ ents said that great sex h@@ its all of the five sens@@ es at an extreme level .
So the five sens@@ es theory does help explain why sex is so good .
Now in the middle of all this five sens@@ es work , I suddenly remem@@ ber@@ ed the so@@ lar@@ -@@ powered c@@ loc@@ ks project from my y@@ outh .
And I realized this theory also expla@@ ins why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
You see , my clock only focu@@ ses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
In fact , in terms of the five sens@@ es , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve main@@ ly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sens@@ es .
Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even rais@@ ing just one of those other sens@@ es can make for a brilliant product .
So what if we started using the five sens@@ es theory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ fu@@ mat@@ or . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
So I br@@ ush my te@@ eth twice a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush that ta@@ st@@ es like c@@ and@@ y , and when the tas@@ te of c@@ and@@ y ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush ?
Fin@@ ally , I have a thing for the keys on a flu@@ te or a clar@@ in@@ et .
It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
Now , I don &apos;t play the flu@@ te or the clar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to comb@@ ine these keys with an instru@@ ment I do play : the television remote control .
Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five sens@@ es theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
Now , I realize the five sens@@ es isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
There &apos;s also the six emotions and that el@@ u@@ sive x@@ -@@ factor .
Maybe that could be the topi@@ c of my next talk .
Un@@ til then , please have fun using the five sens@@ es in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns .
Oh , one last thing before I leave .
And the best way to do that is with free c@@ and@@ y .
You guys ready ?
All right .

But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
So I guess I was the lucky one .
My mother had 16 pregn@@ anci@@ es .
From 16 pregn@@ anci@@ es , five of us are alive .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
D@@ ay to day , I watched women being car@@ ried to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , or watched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard .
At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I complet@@ ed my education , but I wanted to go to university .
Un@@ fortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dor@@ mit@@ ory for girls , so I was accep@@ ted in medical school , but I could not go there .
So as a result , my father sent me to America .
I came to America .
I complet@@ ed my education .
Whi@@ le I was complet@@ ing my education , my country was inv@@ aded by Rus@@ sia .
And do you know that at the time I was complet@@ ing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
My family was in a refuge@@ e cam@@ p .
So as soon as I complet@@ ed my education , I brought my family to America .
I wanted them to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
I was a prof@@ essor at a university .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the refuge@@ e cam@@ p .
And when I went to the refuge@@ e cam@@ p in Pak@@ istan , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million refuge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million refuge@@ es .
Ab@@ out 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refuge@@ e cam@@ p ,
when I went da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day to do a surve@@ y , I found things you never could imagine .
I saw a wi@@ dow with five to eight children sitting there and we@@ eping and not knowing what to do .
I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no enter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live .
I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are sup@@ port@@ ing the family as a 10@@ -@@ to-@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old boy — being the head of the hou@@ se@@ hold , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
So it was a very devast@@ ating situation .
My heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
At that moment , we talk about mo@@ ment@@ um .
At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
How could I help these people ?
I am one individual . What can I do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
It transform@@ ed me . It gave me status .
It gave me confid@@ ence . It gave me a career .
And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
But do you think it was easy ?
No , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for girls , completely .
And also , by Rus@@ sia inv@@ ading Afghanistan , people were not tr@@ ust@@ ing anyone .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
Some@@ body who comes from the United States .
Some@@ body who got educ@@ ated here .
Did they trust me ? Of course not .
So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and surve@@ yed and looked and looked .
I asked .
Fin@@ ally , I found one man .
He was 80 years old .
He was a mu@@ ll@@ ah .
I went to his t@@ ent in the cam@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ raz@@ y woman , crazy woman , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he accep@@ ted my offer , and once I started a class in his com@@ po@@ und , the word spread all over .
In a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 1@@ 5,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
one day I was in the office in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , Pak@@ istan .
All of a sudden , I saw my st@@ af@@ f running to rooms and loc@@ king the do@@ ors and telling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ un away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
You &apos;re scar@@ ed . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on the line .
But as a leader , you have to hold it together .
You have to hold it together and show streng@@ th .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were po@@ uring into my office .
So I invited them to the office .
They came , and there were nine of them — nine T@@ ali@@ ban .
They were the u@@ gli@@ est looking men you can ever see .
( Laughter ) Very mean@@ -@@ looking people , black clo@@ th@@ es , black tur@@ ban , and they po@@ ur into my office .
And I invited them to have a seat and have tea .
They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
And of course , with the t@@ one of voice they were using , it was very scar@@ y , but I was really sha@@ king up .
But also I was strong , holding myself up .
And , of course , by that time , you know how I dres@@ s — I dres@@ s from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ ja@@ b .
The only thing you could see , my eyes .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
Don &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for girls ?
What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ or@@ an , Ho@@ ly Bo@@ ok .
And you know , K@@ or@@ an says that if you learn the Ho@@ ly Bo@@ ok , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can o@@ be@@ y their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking P@@ ash@@ to .
They talked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I offer@@ ed them tea again , and they took a si@@ p and they left .
By that time , my st@@ af@@ f po@@ u@@ red into my office .
They were scar@@ ed to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
( Laughter ) Of course , I was happy to be alive .
But also , as we continu@@ ously gave training during the fall of the T@@ ali@@ ban — of course during the T@@ ali@@ ban there is another story .
We went under@@ ground and we provi@@ ded education for 80 scho@@ ol@@ girls , 3,000 students under@@ ground , and continu@@ ously we trained .
With the fall of the T@@ ali@@ ban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
We opened women &apos;s learning center .
We continu@@ ously opened clin@@ ics .
We worked with mothers and children .
We had re@@ productive health training .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up north of K@@ abu@@ l , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
Ri@@ f@@ les on their shoul@@ ders , they bloc@@ ked the road .
And I told my dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the dri@@ ver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
I am very sha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it .
This time , we all are going to be killed .
There is no doub@@ t in my mind .
But still , the moment comes , and you take streng@@ th from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
My leg was sha@@ king , and I got outside .
And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
We know where you are going .
Every day you go up north here and there .
You train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
You build their skills . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK .
The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gun and kill .
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course .
So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I walked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; Tur@@ n around and go back to the office . &quot; &quot; At that time , we only were sup@@ port@@ ing girls .
We only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
By the time I came to the office , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were gone .
They ran away home . No@@ body st@@ ayed there .
My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
I was sha@@ ken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
Because we had training going on up north already .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of women were there coming to get training .
So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about mo@@ ment@@ um , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful don@@ ors called me about a report .
And she asked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ ak@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; And I ans@@ wer@@ ed her .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing . &quot; &quot; I tried to cover .
No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I told her the whole story .
At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same rou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the ri@@ f@@ le and poin@@ ting to us to stop the car .
So we stopped the car .
I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
So I took them to the mos@@ que , and to make a long story short , I told them I &apos;d give them teachers .
Today , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my gu@@ ides .
Every area that is un@@ known to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . They are ahead , and we go .
And they protect us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That tells you that education transform@@ s people .
When you educ@@ ate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
We cannot only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the har@@ dest time .
( Laughter ) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
So we are continu@@ ously giving training to men , and I really believe str@@ ong@@ ly .
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country .
We were going everywhere .
Women were getting education : law@@ yer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
We never loc@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Today , people cannot walk out of their door without security issues .
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
They are ear@@ ning degrees . They are training to be law@@ y@@ ers .
They are training to be doctors , back again .
So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of trust and hon@@ est@@ y .
If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ compli@@ sh .
We have one po@@ et , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī .
He said that by having compassion and having love , you can con@@ qu@@ er the world .
And I tell you , we could .
And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
Thank you very , very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Par@@ k .
Those are my dad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Par@@ k .
N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Par@@ k is not f@@ enced in the south wid@@ ely , which means wild animals like z@@ ebr@@ as migr@@ ate out of the park fre@@ ely .
So pre@@ dat@@ ors like li@@ ons follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our li@@ v@@ est@@ ock .
This is one of the co@@ ws which was killed at night , and I just wo@@ ke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had .
My community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heav@@ en with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up ha@@ ting li@@ ons so much .
The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who protect our community and the li@@ v@@ est@@ ock , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem .
So they kill the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the six li@@ ons which were killed in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i .
And I think this is why the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Par@@ k li@@ ons are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought li@@ ons were scar@@ ed of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the li@@ ons to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continu@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to tr@@ ick the li@@ ons &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
But li@@ ons are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he ju@@ m@@ ps in and kil@@ ls the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that li@@ ons are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electr@@ on@@ ics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ tery , an indic@@ ator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a mot@@ or@@ cycle , and it helps mot@@ ori@@ sts when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a broken fl@@ ash@@ light .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar pan@@ el char@@ ges the bat@@ tery , and the bat@@ tery sup@@ pli@@ es the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a transform@@ er .
And the indic@@ ator box makes the lights fl@@ ash .
As you can see , the bul@@ bs face outside , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at night .
The lights fl@@ ash and tr@@ ick the li@@ ons into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sle@@ eping in my bed .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with li@@ ons .
And my neighbor@@ ing homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by li@@ ons , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the li@@ on lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ enas , le@@ opar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to s@@ care eleph@@ ants away from people &apos;s far@@ ms .
Because of this inven@@ tion , I was lucky to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house Inter@@ national School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and creating an awar@@ eness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the sav@@ an@@ na gr@@ ass@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an air@@ cra@@ ft engineer and pi@@ lot when I grow up .
I used to hate li@@ ons , but now because my inven@@ tion is saving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the li@@ ons , we are able to stay with the li@@ ons without any conflict .
A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like y@@ ours .
So you got this sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ .@@ Richard Tur@@ ere : Y@@ ep .
CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inv@@ enti@@ ons .

R@@ T : My next inven@@ tion is , I want to make an electric f@@ enc@@ e@@ .@@ CA : E@@ lec@@ tric f@@ ence ?
R@@ T : But I know electric f@@ ences are already invented , but I want to make mine .

( Applause ) May@@ a Pen@@ n : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a cra@@ y@@ on , and I &apos;ve been making anim@@ ated fli@@ p books since I was three years old .
At that age , I also learned about what an anim@@ ator was .
There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
When I understood that an anim@@ ator makes the carto@@ ons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it ment@@ ally or out l@@ oud , but that was a great@@ ly defin@@ ing moment in my life .
An@@ ima@@ tion and art has always been my first love .
It was my love for technology that s@@ par@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; M@@ ali@@ cious D@@ ish@@ es . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do vir@@ us@@ y things ?
And th@@ us , &quot; &quot; M@@ ali@@ cious D@@ ish@@ es &quot; &quot; was born .
At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
That started my love for technology .
I built my first website myself in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m learning J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ crip@@ t and P@@ y@@ th@@ on .
I &apos;m also working on an anim@@ ated series called &quot; &quot; The Po@@ ll@@ in@@ ators . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other poll@@ in@@ ators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
If plants aren &apos;t poll@@ in@@ ated by the poll@@ in@@ ators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depen@@ d on these plants , would star@@ ve .
So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a super@@ h@@ ero team .
( Applause ) ( Fo@@ ot st@@ om@@ p ) ( Music ) ( Ro@@ ar ) Po@@ ll@@ in@@ ator : De@@ for@@ est@@ sa@@ ur@@ us ! I should have known !
I need to call on the rest of the Po@@ ll@@ in@@ ators !
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my anima@@ tions start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
I@@ de@@ as can s@@ park a movement .
I@@ de@@ as are opportunities and innovation .
I@@ de@@ as truly are what make the world go round .
If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called May@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my non@@ profit , May@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ lan@@ et .
( Laughter ) And I make eco@@ -@@ friend@@ ly clo@@ thing and acc@@ ess@@ ories .
I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my arti@@ stic journey started way before then .
I was great@@ ly influ@@ enced by art , and I wanted to incorpor@@ ate it in everything I did , even my business .
I would find different fabr@@ ics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scar@@ f or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for desig@@ ns .
I noticed when I wor@@ e my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cu@@ te . Where can I get one ? &quot;
And I thought , I can start my own business .
Now I didn &apos;t have any business plan@@ s at only eight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
I started making more it@@ ems like ha@@ ts , scar@@ ves and b@@ ags .
So@@ on , my it@@ ems began selling all over the world , and I had cust@@ omers in Den@@ mark , I@@ tal@@ y , Australia , Canada and more .
Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like br@@ anding and marketing , st@@ aying eng@@ aged with my cust@@ omers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
So@@ on , my business really started to take off .
Then one day , For@@ bes magazine cont@@ acted me when I was 10 years old .
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ ature me and my company in their article .
Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco@@ -@@ friend@@ ly ?
I &apos;ve had a passion for prot@@ ecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
I heard about how the d@@ yes in some clo@@ thing or the process of even making the it@@ ems was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after dy@@ e@@ ing has being complet@@ ed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
For example , the gr@@ in@@ ding of materials , or the du@@ mp@@ ing of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der materials .
These actions can pollu@@ te the air , making it toxi@@ c to anyone or anything that in@@ h@@ ales it .
( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entreprene@@ urs that not only see@@ ks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
I feel that I can meet the needs of my cust@@ omers without compro@@ mis@@ ing the ability of future generations to live in a green@@ er tomorrow .
We live in a big , diver@@ se and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
It takes to get it through your hear@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are s@@ par@@ ked .
That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
Thank you , and peace and bl@@ ess@@ ings .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ itch@@ ell : So , you heard May@@ a talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
Please , Mr. and M@@ r@@ s. Pen@@ n . Would you just — Ah !
( Applause )
You know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ grap@@ hic research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , tas@@ te it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
Just to know that J@@ agu@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still journey beyond the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the I@@ nu@@ it el@@ ders still reson@@ ate with meaning , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a , the Bu@@ dd@@ hist@@ s still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central revel@@ ation of an@@ thro@@ po@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolu@@ te sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequ@@ ence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ atives .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initi@@ ation rit@@ es .
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the for@@ ests of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o a@@ col@@ y@@ tes in Hait@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t desert of Nor@@ thern Kenya , the C@@ ur@@ and@@ ero in the moun@@ tains of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the Sahar@@ a — this is incid@@ ent@@ ally the fellow that I travel@@ ed into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ pes of Q@@ o@@ mo@@ lan@@ g@@ ma , Ever@@ est , the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mother of the world .
All of these pe@@ o@@ ples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orient@@ ing yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a web of spir@@ itual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .
The eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bol of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ quisi@@ tive species .
And just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
No bio@@ logists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ext@@ inc@@ tion because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ enario in the real@@ m of biological diversity — scar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ aches what we know to be the most optimis@@ tic sc@@ enario in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
And the great indic@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gr@@ am@@ ma@@ tical rules .
A language is a fl@@ ash of the human spirit .
It &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
Every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ecos@@ y@@ stem of spir@@ itual possibilities .
And of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancest@@ ors or anticip@@ ate the promise of the children ?
And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is indeed the pli@@ ght of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and carri@@ es with him into the gr@@ ave the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ ba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a bri@@ ef journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Take , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ west Amazon , the people of the an@@ a@@ con@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k river from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red s@@ na@@ kes .
Now , this is a people who cogni@@ tiv@@ ely do not distingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ opy of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ opy of the forest upon which the people depen@@ d .
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; lin@@ gu@@ istic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ aks a different language .
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes I ever lived with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ aster@@ n E@@ cu@@ ador , an ast@@ on@@ ishing people first cont@@ acted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 195@@ 8 .
In 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mist@@ ake .
They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ s@@ sy photograph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly g@@ est@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ infor@@ est had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
They picked up these photograph@@ s from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the de@@ vil , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
We trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
Their hun@@ ters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ aces and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ essor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Hait@@ i , in@@ fil@@ trat@@ ing the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ vali@@ er &apos;s streng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton Ma@@ cou@@ tes , and sec@@ uring the po@@ ison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
On the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex metap@@ hy@@ sical world@@ view .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Christi@@ an@@ ity , Islam , Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sm , Ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa had no religious beli@@ efs . Well , of course , they did and Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the trag@@ ic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very era .
But , what makes Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give birth to the spir@@ its .
The spir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ ath the Great W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance to mo@@ ment@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ ining moment , the a@@ col@@ y@@ te becomes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to ch@@ urch and speak about God .
We dance in the tem@@ ple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be har@@ med ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demonstr@@ ations : Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o a@@ col@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demonstr@@ ation of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the state of extreme exci@@ tation .
Now , of all the pe@@ o@@ ples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the K@@ og@@ i of the Si@@ erra N@@ ev@@ ada de S@@ anta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ thern Co@@ lo@@ m@@ bia .
D@@ esc@@ end@@ ants of the ancient T@@ air@@ ona civilization which once car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of Co@@ lo@@ m@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars above the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
In a bloo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed continent , these people alone were never con@@ quer@@ ed by the S@@ pan@@ ish .
To this day , they re@@ main r@@ ul@@ ed by a rit@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the training for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extraordinary .
The young a@@ col@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequ@@ ester@@ ed in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of glaci@@ ers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deliber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to mi@@ mic the nine months of g@@ est@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are metap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are in@@ cultur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone main@@ tain the cos@@ mic — or we might say the eco@@ logical — balance .
And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . And in that cr@@ yst@@ al moment of awar@@ eness of first light as the Sun begins to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ pes of the st@@ un@@ ning@@ ly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstr@@ act is af@@ fir@@ med in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
Now , this level of intui@@ tion becomes very important .
Wh@@ enever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea raci@@ st in its simpli@@ city , or altern@@ ativ@@ ely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther senti@@ mental n@@ or we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of Ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and rit@@ ual , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intui@@ tion : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her destin@@ y will be a prof@@ oun@@ dly different human being and have a different relationship to that resour@@ ce or that place than a young kid from Mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pi@@ le of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ relevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the for@@ ests of British C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia to believe those for@@ ests exist@@ ed to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ ests were the abo@@ de of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the north end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to engage during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ veri@@ es . Take this plant here .
It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Nor@@ th@@ west Amazon just last A@@ pri@@ l .
This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ co@@ logical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the elabor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this wo@@ o@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ bo@@ lines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ geni@@ c — to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ z@@ y smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mi@@ xed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ria vi@@ ri@@ di@@ s .
This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their nos@@ es , that subst@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pa@@ int@@ ings and l@@ anding on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the dist@@ or@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
In fact , I used to argue with my prof@@ essor , Richard E@@ van S@@ hu@@ l@@ tes — who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mus@@ h@@ rooms in Mexico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t clas@@ si@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ geni@@ c because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human gu@@ t called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine oxi@@ da@@ se .
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ c@@ tion with some other chemical that den@@ atures the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ bo@@ lines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the preci@@ se sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ically un@@ related plants that when comb@@ ined in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 17 vari@@ eties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they establi@@ sh their tax@@ on@@ o@@ my and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ eties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the pli@@ ght of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but somehow reduc@@ ed to the mar@@ gin@@ s of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technological innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either activ@@ ely end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ sively accep@@ ted the massive destruc@@ tion of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cul@@ tures through all time have constantly been eng@@ aged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and arro@@ w any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . It is power , the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation .
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cul@@ tures dest@@ ined to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living pe@@ o@@ ples being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adap@@ t to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an — a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia , from Sar@@ aw@@ ak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carr@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away
to the South China Se@@ a , where the Jap@@ an@@ ese fre@@ igh@@ ters han@@ g light in the hori@@ zon ready to fill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest — or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
Or if we go into the moun@@ tains of Ti@@ bet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation .
You know , genoci@@ de , the physical ext@@ inc@@ tion of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the destruc@@ tion of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
And you cannot understand the pain of Ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once travel@@ led 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ aster@@ n Ti@@ bet to L@@ ha@@ sa with a young colleagu@@ e , and it was only when I got to L@@ ha@@ sa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments tor@@ n apart to d@@ ust and ash@@ es , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the cad@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ ama .
That meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the Chinese invasi@@ on .
His un@@ cle fl@@ ed with His H@@ ol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al .
His mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being we@@ al@@ thy .
He was s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ed into the j@@ ail at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
The sister who had done that br@@ ave deed was put into an education cam@@ p .
One day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently st@@ ep@@ ped on an ar@@ mb@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gres@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
The pain of Ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ dem@@ p@@ tive spirit of the people is something to be@@ hold .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embr@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ matic world of diversity ?
Mar@@ gar@@ et Me@@ ad , the great an@@ thro@@ po@@ logist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly amor@@ ph@@ ous gen@@ eri@@ c world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduc@@ ed to a more n@@ arro@@ w mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
And it &apos;s hu@@ m@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cu@@ mb@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the poe@@ try of the sha@@ man was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus — is only 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
Now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mill@@ en@@ nia .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ o@@ ples and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh . And there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
This is a photograph I took at the nor@@ thern ti@@ p of B@@ af@@ fin Is@@ land when I went nar@@ w@@ ha@@ l hun@@ ting with some I@@ nu@@ it people , and this man , Ol@@ ayu@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
The Can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the I@@ nu@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to establi@@ sh our so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ l@@ ements .
This old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
The family , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the I@@ nu@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wr@@ apped in c@@ ari@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de .
So , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He simply sli@@ pped outside , pu@@ lled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and def@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ eces began to free@@ ze , he shap@@ ed it into the form of a bl@@ ade .
He put a spr@@ ay of sali@@ va on the edge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it .
He sk@@ in@@ ned the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent dog , and dis@@ appeared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t .
Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a sym@@ bol of the resili@@ ence of the I@@ nu@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The Can@@ adi@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the I@@ nu@@ it an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
It &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an independent territ@@ ory . They control all min@@ eral resources .
An amazing example of how a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state can see@@ k res@@ titu@@ tion with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed in these remote re@@ aches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
They &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
They represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the da@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked ge@@ ograph@@ y of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Ge@@ ographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ compli@@ sh anything .
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics — ( Applause ) — we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not persu@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling institu@@ tion in the world . We get 35 million h@@ its on our website every month .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television chan@@ nel .
Our mag@@ az@@ ines are read by millions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embr@@ ace grad@@ ually , one by one , the central revel@@ ation of an@@ thro@@ po@@ logy : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multi@@ cultural , pl@@ ur@@ al@@ istic world where all of the wisdom of all pe@@ o@@ ples can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
Thank you very much .

When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execu@@ tion .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Kore@@ an refuge@@ e .
If anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated .
Even though I was really fortun@@ ate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an inst@@ ant .
We are all Kore@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , due to 6@@ 7 years of divi@@ sion .
A@@ m I South Kore@@ an or North Kore@@ an ?
So I started planning how to help them escape .
I was so surprised that a total str@@ anger car@@ ed enough to ask .
I realized that this was a symbo@@ lic moment in my life .
( Music ) ( Applause )
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we designed in 2007 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a circle .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less circul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cles .
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
The principal of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a hand@@ ra@@ il . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; How about having a net stic@@ king out from the edge of the ro@@ of ?
So that it can catch the children fall@@ ing off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government of@@ ficial said , &quot; Of course you have to have a hand@@ ra@@ il . &quot;
But we could keep that idea around the trees .
There are three trees po@@ pping through .
And we were allowed to call this ro@@ pe as a hand@@ ra@@ il .
But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them .
They fall into the net .
And you get more , and more , more .
( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
The boy on the bran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the tree so he is eating the tree .
( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
It looks so nice from underneath .
Mon@@ keys in the zo@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ eding time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only underneath the ro@@ of .
And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ iling .
And the leg was@@ h@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water tap@@ s .
You see with the flexible tu@@ bes , you want to spr@@ ay water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite normal .
But if you look at this , the boy is not was@@ h@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s putting water into his bo@@ ots .
( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year .
And there is no bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y between inside and outside .
So it means basically this architecture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y between class@@ rooms .
So there is no aco@@ us@@ tic barri@@ er at all .
When you put many children in a qui@@ et box , some of them get really nervous .
But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get nervous .
Because there is no bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y .
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on , usually children try to hi@@ de somewhere .
But here , just they leave and come back .
It &apos;s a natural process .
And secon@@ dly , we consider noise very important .
You know that children sleep better in noise .
They don &apos;t sleep in a qui@@ et space .
And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing concentr@@ ation in class .
And you know , our kind grew up in the jun@@ g@@ le with noise .
They need noise .
And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y bar .
You are not supposed to be in sil@@ ence .
And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
You know , it &apos;s completely open .
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 degrees in win@@ ter .
In summer you go swimming .
The sand is 50 degrees .
And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of .
You never mel@@ t in rain .
So , children are supposed to be outside .
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divi@@ de class@@ rooms .
They are supposed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A class@@ room .
And a was@@ h@@ basi@@ n .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some trees in the class@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from above .
( Laughter ) Mon@@ keys . ( Laughter )
And each class@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ anta C@@ lau@@ s comes down at the time of Christ@@ mas .
This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
The building is only five meters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
And of course , the ce@@ iling he@@ ight is very low .
So you have to consider safety .
So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His sk@@ ul@@ l is quite strong .
He is resili@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
And then we put other children .
The traffic j@@ am is awful in To@@ k@@ yo , as you know .
( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
Now these days , kids need a small do@@ s@@ age of dan@@ ger .
And in this kind of oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on , they learn to help each other .
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
And the circum@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 18@@ 3 meters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
And this boy did 6@@ ,000 meters in the morning .
But the surprise is yet to come .
The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 meters on average .
And these children have the highest ath@@ le@@ tic abilities among many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens .
The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of .
Just like she@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes .
They need to get some inj@@ ury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
And this is one of the attemp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

I &apos;m a little bit lost , and it &apos;s finally time to make a real connection .
Who am I ?
( D@@ ru@@ ms ) I &apos;m a single white male , 45 years of age .
I love animals .
G@@ ain@@ fully employ@@ ed .
I &apos;m a people person .
I keep fit .
Who am I looking for ?
I &apos;m looking for my idea mate .
Are you that idea that mat@@ ches with who I really am ?
( Video ) R@@ on Fin@@ ley : How would you feel if you had no access to healthy food ?

That &apos;s the situation .

R@@ W : I want to have your idea baby .
R@@ Wat@@ ts : Well , you know what they say in Rus@@ sia .
T@@ en years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
At the time , I was cardi@@ olog@@ ist at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ aliz@@ ing in cardi@@ ac ima@@ ging techniques .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the zo@@ o and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardi@@ ac cause .
Now , to be clear , North American zo@@ os are st@@ aff@@ ed by highly qu@@ ali@@ fied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ certi@@ fied veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ standing care of their animal patients .
Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A Medic@@ al Center with physici@@ ans , discus@@ sing symp@@ tom@@ s and diagnos@@ es and treat@@ ments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o with veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , discus@@ sing symp@@ tom@@ s and diagnos@@ es and treat@@ ments for their animal patients .
And oc@@ c@@ asion@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on ro@@ unds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A Medic@@ al Center and at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
Now , I &apos;ve got a conf@@ es@@ sion to make .
So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ lap@@ s , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veter@@ in@@ arian , or consul@@ t the veter@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for insi@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?
Why had I never , n@@ or had any of my physici@@ an friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever atten@@ ded a veter@@ in@@ ary conference ?
For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
I mean , look , every single physici@@ an accep@@ ts some biological connection between animals and humans .
Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separ@@ ation in our world between the urban and the non@@ urban .
You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wo@@ ol gro@@ ws on trees or that che@@ ese comes from a plant .
But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
P@@ hy@@ sici@@ ans and scientists , we accept intellec@@ tually that our species , Ho@@ mo sa@@ pi@@ ens , is mer@@ ely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
I feel that tu@@ g of human excep@@ tion@@ alism , even as I recognize the scienti@@ fically isol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart failure .
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnos@@ is was ne@@ i@@ ther new , n@@ or was it uni@@ qu@@ ely human .
V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been diagnos@@ ing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ vent@@ ing emo@@ tionally in@@ duc@@ ed symp@@ tom@@ s in animals ran@@ ging from mon@@ keys to fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os , from to de@@ er to rab@@ bits , since the 197@@ 0s .
How many human lives might have been saved if this veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and cardi@@ o@@ logists ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ inj@@ ury .
Some human patients har@@ m themselves .
There are st@@ al@@ li@@ ons that repe@@ ti@@ tiv@@ ely bi@@ te their f@@ lan@@ ks until they ble@@ ed .
But veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very specific and very effective ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ vent@@ ing self-@@ inj@@ ury in their self-@@ inj@@ uring animals .
S@@ hou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t this veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge be put into the hands of psycho@@ ther@@ api@@ sts and parents and patients stru@@ ggl@@ ing with self-@@ inj@@ ury ?
Po@@ st@@ par@@ tum depression and post@@ par@@ tum psy@@ ch@@ os@@ is .
Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depres@@ sed , and sometimes they become seriously depres@@ sed and even psycho@@ tic .
They may ne@@ gl@@ ect their new@@ born , and in some extreme cases , even har@@ m the child .
E@@ qu@@ ine veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ c@@ asion@@ ally , a m@@ are , soon after giving birth , will ne@@ gl@@ ect the fo@@ al , re@@ f@@ using to nur@@ se , and in some inst@@ ances , k@@ ick the fo@@ al , even to death .
But veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vis@@ ed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ j@@ ection syn@@ dro@@ me that invol@@ ves increasing oxy@@ to@@ ci@@ n in the m@@ are .
Ox@@ y@@ to@@ ci@@ n is the bon@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this leads to ren@@ e@@ wed interest , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al .
S@@ hou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family doctors and patients who are stru@@ ggl@@ ing with post@@ par@@ tum depression and psy@@ ch@@ os@@ is ?
Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gu@@ l@@ f between our fields rema@@ ins large .
To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dir@@ ty laun@@ dry .
Some physici@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ bs about doctors who are not M@@ .@@ D. &apos; s .
I &apos;m talking about d@@ enti@@ sts and op@@ to@@ me@@ tri@@ sts and psycho@@ logists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
So I don &apos;t bl@@ ame the v@@ ets for feeling anno@@ yed by my profes@@ sion &apos;s con@@ descen@@ sion and ignor@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the v@@ ets : What do you call a veter@@ in@@ arian who can only take care of one species ?
In the United States and now intern@@ ation@@ ally , at Z@@ o@@ o@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity confer@@ ences physici@@ ans and veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans check their at@@ titu@@ des and their pre@@ concep@@ tions at the door and come together as colleagues , as pe@@ ers , as doctors .
And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and he@@ al .
Thank you .
Can ge@@ ographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
I found myself in a hospital in an intensi@@ ve-@@ care ward , recuper@@ ating from emer@@ gency surgery .
And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the for@@ mula for life and good health .
Gen@@ e@@ tics , lif@@ est@@ yle and environment .
That &apos;s going to sort of con@@ tain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
Well , I understand the gene@@ tics and lif@@ est@@ yle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physici@@ ans constantly ask me questions about this .
Have you ever had to fill out those long , leg@@ al-@@ size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lif@@ est@@ yle and your family history , your medic@@ ation history , your surg@@ ical history , your all@@ erg@@ y history ... did I forget any history ?
But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physici@@ ans really get this part of the equ@@ ation .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
Whi@@ le I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
Just think about that , you know , w@@ ander through your life thinking about this .
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good por@@ tion of your time travel@@ ing some place .
So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
And where do you ex@@ pose y@@ ourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclu@@ sion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
And I don &apos;t w@@ ander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an exten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker .
Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
I started off in S@@ cr@@ ant@@ on , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
I don &apos;t know if anybody might ha@@ il from nor@@ the@@ aster@@ n Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lun@@ gs .
You know , brea@@ thing high concentr@@ ations here of sul@@ fu@@ r di@@ oxi@@ de , carbon di@@ oxi@@ de and meth@@ ane gas , in un@@ equal qu@@ anti@@ ties — 19 years of this .
And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those pi@@ les of bur@@ ning , s@@ mol@@ der@@ ing co@@ al waste look like .
So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid@@ -@@ west .
OK , so I ended up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ vi@@ lle , K@@ ent@@ uc@@ ky .
Well , I decided to be neighb@@ ors to a place called Ru@@ b@@ ber@@ town .
They manufac@@ ture plas@@ tics . They use large qu@@ anti@@ ties ch@@ l@@ or@@ o@@ pren@@ e and b@@ enz@@ ene .
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my mid@@ d@@ le-@@ age lun@@ gs now , brea@@ thing various concentr@@ ations of that .
And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
It was insi@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Co@@ ast .
And I moved to R@@ ed@@ lands California .
Very nice , and there my older , sen@@ ior lun@@ gs , as I like to call them , I filled with particul@@ ate matter , carbon di@@ oxi@@ de and very high do@@ ses of o@@ zone .
Okay ? Al@@ most like the highest in the nation .
Al@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day .
If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the dr@@ inking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ing@@ est into my st@@ om@@ ach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars invest@@ ing in this kind of research .
Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ cl@@ ed the places where I &apos;ve been .
Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
So , how many people are in the white ?
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
Any@@ body ? B@@ oy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
There are thousands of these kinds of ma@@ ps that are dis@@ played in at@@ l@@ ases all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train w@@ rec@@ k .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ ours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
He &apos;s a colleagu@@ e . He allowed his cell phone to be trac@@ ked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 3@@ 65 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really studied that you might have some clu@@ es as to what Paul li@@ kes to do .
Any@@ body got any clu@@ es ? Sk@@ i . Right .
We can zo@@ om in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
And all of those black dots are all of the toxi@@ c release invent@@ ories that are monit@@ ored by the E@@ P@@ A .
Did you know that data exist@@ ed ?
For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ alized map of that .
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physici@@ an would have in front of him and her when we enter that ex@@ am room instead of just the p@@ ink sli@@ p that said I paid at the coun@@ ter . Right ?
This could be my little ass@@ ess@@ ment .
And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ a Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ clock at night .
I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pres@@ crip@@ tions .
Okay , number one is , we must teach physici@@ ans about the value of ge@@ ograph@@ ical information .
It &apos;s called geo@@ medicine . There are about a half a do@@ zen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
And they &apos;re in the early st@@ ages of development .
These programs need to be sup@@ port@@ ed , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electr@@ onic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
It not only will be important for the physici@@ an ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge sam@@ ples to draw upon .
But it will also be useful for us .
I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ zone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
Or I could negoti@@ ate with my employ@@ er to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
With that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ or@@ d said this almost 10 years ago .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what the conclu@@ sion of the D@@ art@@ mouth At@@ las of He@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can explain the ge@@ ographic vari@@ ations that occu@@ r in disease , in ill@@ ness , in well@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ ates .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really se@@ ize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical recor@@ ds .
So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Ge@@ ograph@@ y always matters .
And I believe that ge@@ ographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .

So I was trained to become a g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast for two years in H@@ un@@ an , China in the 197@@ 0s .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to trans@@ fer me to a school for ath@@ le@@ tes , all ex@@ pens@@ es paid .
But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
After sur@@ vi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evolution , they fir@@ m@@ ly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-@@ paid job .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese oper@@ a sing@@ er .
That is me playing my imagin@@ ary piano .
An oper@@ a sing@@ er must start training young to learn ac@@ rob@@ ati@@ c@@ s , so I tried everything I could to go to oper@@ a school .
I even wrote to the school principal and the ho@@ st of a radio show .
But no adults li@@ ked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
On@@ ly my friends sup@@ port@@ ed me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fair .
So I was determin@@ ed to find another calling .
No@@ body around to teach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I satis@@ fied my hun@@ ger for par@@ ental adv@@ ice from this book by a family of writ@@ ers and mu@@ sici@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ence in the F@@ ami@@ ly of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tradition requires o@@ be@@ di@@ ence . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ ane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Che@@ aper by the Do@@ zen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study ab@@ road after reading these .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Com@@ pl@@ ete Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( ak@@ a E@@ cho C@@ han ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ es@@ sons From H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; &quot; by N@@ an Hu@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S. in 199@@ 5 , so which books did I read here first ?
Bo@@ o@@ ks ban@@ ned in China , of course .
&quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not conveni@@ ent for propag@@ anda . Go@@ t it .
The Bi@@ ble is interesting , but strange .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topi@@ c for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th com@@ man@@ d@@ ment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
&quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to cli@@ mb out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to rest@@ art my relationship with my parents .
En@@ counter@@ ing a new culture also started my hab@@ it of compar@@ ative reading .
For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
It had never occur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually carri@@ es somebody &apos;s view .
Com@@ par@@ ative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academ@@ ic world .
There are even research fields such as compar@@ ative religion and compar@@ ative liter@@ ature .
Com@@ par@@ e and contr@@ ast gives sch@@ ol@@ ars a more complete understanding of a topi@@ c .
So I thought , well , if compar@@ ative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So I started reading books in p@@ airs .
So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ jam@@ in Fran@@ k@@ lin &quot; &quot; by Wal@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John A@@ dam@@ s &quot; &quot; by David Mc@@ Cu@@ ll@@ ough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Per@@ son@@ al H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; &quot; by K@@ ath@@ ar@@ ine G@@ ra@@ ham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The S@@ now@@ ball : W@@ arr@@ en Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and the Bus@@ iness of Life , &quot; &quot; by Ali@@ ce Sch@@ ro@@ eder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different gen@@ res — ( Laughter ) &#91; Ho@@ ly Bi@@ ble : King James Ver@@ sion &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ am@@ b &quot; &quot; by Chri@@ so@@ ph@@ er Mo@@ ore &#93; — or similar stories from different cul@@ tures , as Jo@@ sep@@ h Cam@@ p@@ b@@ ell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Po@@ wer of M@@ y@@ th &quot; &quot; by Jo@@ sep@@ h Cam@@ p@@ b@@ ell &#93; For example , both the Chri@@ st and the Bu@@ dd@@ ha went through three t@@ emp@@ t@@ ations .
For the Chri@@ st , the t@@ emp@@ t@@ ations are economic , political and spir@@ itual .
For the Bu@@ dd@@ ha , they are all psycho@@ logical : l@@ ust , fear and social du@@ ty — interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The W@@ ay of C@@ hu@@ an@@ g T@@ z@@ u &quot; &quot; Thomas M@@ er@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ a@@ o : The Wat@@ er@@ course W@@ ay &quot; &quot; Al@@ an Wat@@ ts &#93; Instead of lost in transl@@ ation , I found there is much to gain .
For example , it &apos;s through transl@@ ation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Hu@@ h !
&quot; &quot; Bri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
( Laughter ) Bo@@ o@@ ks have given me a magic port@@ al to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ aving a dream s@@ hat@@ tered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffer@@ ed .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
I@@ ts most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a s@@ hat@@ tered dream can do that for you .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clar@@ ity , most of the time .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m an American , which means , gener@@ ally , I ignor@@ e foot@@ ball unless it invol@@ ves guys my size or Br@@ uno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high spe@@ eds .
That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignor@@ e foot@@ ball for the last couple of weeks .
I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : F@@ I@@ F@@ A , vu@@ vu@@ z@@ ela , weird jo@@ kes about oc@@ top@@ i .
But the one that &apos;s really been sort of str@@ essing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this ph@@ rase &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a boca , Gal@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
It &apos;s been a major tr@@ en@@ ding topi@@ c .
Be@@ ing a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the ph@@ rase means .
So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a boca , Gal@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Braz@@ ili@@ an friends were more than ready to help .
They expla@@ ined that the Gal@@ va@@ o bird is a rare and end@@ an@@ ger@@ ed par@@ ro@@ t that &apos;s in terrible , terrible dan@@ ger .
In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
N@@ arr@@ ator : A word about Gal@@ va@@ o , a very rare kind of bird n@@ ative to Brazil .
Every year , more than 3@@ 00,000 Gal@@ va@@ o birds are killed during Car@@ ni@@ val par@@ ades .
E@@ than Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ man : Obvi@@ ously , this is a trag@@ ic situation , and it actually gets worse .
It turns out that , not only is the Gal@@ va@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very at@@ trac@@ tive , useful for head@@ dres@@ ses , it evid@@ ently has certain hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ geni@@ c properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Gal@@ va@@ o ab@@ use .
Some sick and tw@@ ist@@ ed people have found themselves s@@ nor@@ ting Gal@@ va@@ o .
And it &apos;s terri@@ bly end@@ an@@ ger@@ ed .
The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Braz@@ ili@@ an friends tell me — is pit@@ ching in to help out .
It turns out that L@@ ady G@@ ag@@ a has rele@@ ased a new single — actually five or six new sing@@ les , as near as I can tell — ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a boca , Gal@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my Braz@@ ili@@ an friends tell me that if I just tw@@ e@@ et the ph@@ rase &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a boca , Gal@@ va@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 c@@ ents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
Now , most of you have figured out that this was a pr@@ ank , and actually a very , very good one .
&quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a boca , Gal@@ va@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
In Por@@ tu@@ g@@ ese , it means &quot; &quot; S@@ hu@@ t your mouth , Gal@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refer@@ s to this guy , Gal@@ va@@ o Bueno , who &apos;s the lead so@@ c@@ cer com@@ ment@@ ator for Re@@ de Glob@@ o .
And what I understand from my Braz@@ ili@@ an friends is that this guy is just a cli@@ che machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting match by just spo@@ u@@ ting cli@@ che again and again and again .
So Braz@@ ili@@ ans went to that first match against North Kore@@ a , put up this ban@@ ner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to conv@@ ince the rest of us to tw@@ e@@ et the ph@@ rase : &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a boca , Gal@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it to@@ pped Twitter for two weeks .
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of les@@ sons that you can take from this .
And the first lesson , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as acti@@ vis@@ m just means re@@ tw@@ e@@ eting a ph@@ rase .
So as long as acti@@ vis@@ m is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Braz@@ ili@@ ans on Twitter .
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
As far as national represent@@ ation , 11 percent of Braz@@ ili@@ an internet users are on Twitter .
That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
N@@ ext to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represent@@ ed by population .
Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Braz@@ ili@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have ch@@ os@@ en to interact with .
And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guys .
And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very he@@ avi@@ ly Braz@@ ili@@ an space .
It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a he@@ avi@@ ly Afric@@ an-@@ American space .
Twitter recently did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are Afric@@ an-@@ American .
That &apos;s about twice as high as Afric@@ an-@@ Americans are represent@@ ed in the population .
And again , that was very sho@@ c@@ king to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ ren@@ ding T@@ op@@ ics .
And you tend to find to@@ pic@@ s that are almost entirely Afric@@ an-@@ American conversations .
This was a visu@@ alization done by F@@ ern@@ ando Vi@@ eg@@ as and Martin W@@ atten@@ berg , two amazing visu@@ alization designers , who looked at a wee@@ k@@ end &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these tr@@ en@@ ding to@@ pic@@ s were basically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
It turns out that oil spi@@ ll is a mostly white conversation , that coo@@ k@@ out is a mostly black conversation .
And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
You click on that coo@@ k@@ out ta@@ g , there an entirely different conversation with different people particip@@ ating in it .
But gener@@ ally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ bles , as my friend El@@ i Par@@ is@@ er calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
And we tend not to see that wi@@ der picture .
Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cy@@ ber@@ -@@ u@@ topi@@ ans like N@@ ick Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing D@@ ig@@ ital , &quot; &quot; the predic@@ tion was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smo@@ oth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of at@@ oms .
He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table .
And Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te says this is crazy .
This is the old economy .
It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow at@@ oms over long dist@@ ances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
We &apos;re head@@ ing to the future of bits , where everything is spe@@ edy , it &apos;s we@@ igh@@ t@@ less .
It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
Now , Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things .
He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many cases at@@ oms are much more mobile than bits .
If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in Fi@@ j@@ i , shi@@ pped at great expen@@ se to the United States .
It &apos;s actually surpri@@ sing@@ ly hard for me to see a Fi@@ ji@@ an fe@@ ature film .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fi@@ ji@@ an music .
It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fi@@ ji@@ an news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fi@@ j@@ i .
There &apos;s a co@@ up government . There &apos;s a military government .
There &apos;s cr@@ ack@@ dow@@ ns on the press .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of glob@@ alization .
We look at the fr@@ ame@@ work that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
And that &apos;s a fr@@ ame@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line rou@@ tes .
It inclu@@ des things like the Internet cables .
We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is fl@@ at because everything is a ho@@ p or two away .
You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Ban@@ gal@@ ore later today .
Two ho@@ ps , you &apos;re in Su@@ va , the capit@@ ol of Fi@@ j@@ i .
It &apos;s all right there .
When you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
You start looking at how the global plane f@@ lights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to fl@@ at .
It &apos;s extremely lu@@ mp@@ y .
There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
There &apos;s basically a giant path@@ way in the sky between London and New York .
but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the glo@@ be that are syst@@ em@@ atically cut off .
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realiz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
The world is , in fact , getting more global .
It &apos;s getting more connected .
More of problems are global in scale .
More of our economics is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
If you watched a television broad@@ cas@@ t in the United States in the 197@@ 0s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a ni@@ ghtly new broad@@ cas@@ t .
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very dist@@ or@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a slide that Ali@@ sa M@@ ill@@ er showed at a previ@@ ous TED Talk .
Ali@@ sa &apos;s the president of Pu@@ bli@@ c R@@ adi@@ o Inter@@ national .
And she made a carto@@ gr@@ am , which is basically a dist@@ or@@ ted map based on what American television news c@@ ast@@ s looked at for a month .
And you see that when you dist@@ or@@ t a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduc@@ ed to this giant blo@@ ated U.S.
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
And before you conclu@@ de that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I agree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been ma@@ pping eli@@ te media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
When you look at the New York Times , you look at other eli@@ te media , what you larg@@ ely get are pictures of very we@@ al@@ thy nations and the nations we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a map made by Mark G@@ ra@@ ham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
A this is a map of artic@@ les in Wikipedia that have been ge@@ o-@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bi@@ as towards North America and Western Europe .
Even within Wiki@@ pedi@@ as , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bi@@ as towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia auth@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this ses@@ sion , you could read a new@@ sp@@ aper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God for@@ bi@@ d from the U.S.
You probably won &apos;t .
If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news read@@ ership is on dom@@ esti@@ c news sites .
It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than v@@ ice ver@@ sa .
So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I re@@ fer to as imagin@@ ary cos@@ mo@@ poli@@ tan@@ ism .
We look at the internet .
We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the glo@@ be .
We oc@@ c@@ asion@@ ally stu@@ m@@ ble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re chec@@ king Boston R@@ ed So@@ x s@@ cor@@ es .
So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed So@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discus@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and s@@ cope , they requi@@ re global conversations to get to global solutions .
This is a problem we have to solve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
For six years , I &apos;ve been han@@ ging out with these guys .
This is a group called Global Vo@@ ices .
This is a team of b@@ log@@ gers from around the world .
Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
We started in 2004 .
You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting les@@ sons for how we would re@@ wi@@ re if we we wanted to use the web to have a wi@@ der world .
The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spo@@ ts in terms of attention .
In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encour@@ agement .
One of those dark spo@@ ts is Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works film than it is actually known for the lo@@ v@@ ely people who live there .
And so the people who foun@@ ded F@@ ok@@ o C@@ lu@@ b in Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much simpl@@ er .
It was a clu@@ b to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
but what happened was that Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car went through a violent co@@ up .
Most independent media was shu@@ t down .
And the high school students who were learning to blog through F@@ ok@@ o C@@ lu@@ b suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstr@@ ations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publi@@ sh@@ ing their own thoughts , publi@@ sh@@ ing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
Now the tr@@ ick with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ essing most people here don &apos;t speak Mal@@ ag@@ as@@ y .
I &apos;m also gu@@ essing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represent@@ ed language on the internet .
For@@ tun@@ ately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
If you &apos;re using Google Ch@@ ro@@ me and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cu@@ te box at the top , which automa@@ tically det@@ ects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a transl@@ ation of the page .
Un@@ fortunately , it &apos;s a machine transl@@ ation of the page .
And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Chinese .
And the results can be pretty funny .
What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a bu@@ tton and have this que@@ u@@ ed so a human being can trans@@ late this .
And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not .
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an .
And Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an is a group of 15@@ 0,000 volunte@@ ers who get online every day .
They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
They trans@@ late roughly 100 artic@@ les a day from major new@@ s@@ papers , major web@@ sites .
They put it online for free .
It &apos;s the project of a guy named Z@@ han@@ g Le@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ ha@@ sa ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ ased American media co@@ ver@@ age was .
And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start transl@@ ating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an can line up 15@@ 0,000 people to trans@@ late the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an ?
Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
So even if we can find a way to trans@@ late from Chinese , there &apos;s no guar@@ ant@@ ee that we &apos;re going to find it .
When we look for information online , we basically have two strategi@@ es .
We use a lot of search .
And search is terri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to stu@@ m@@ ble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosoph@@ y is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the f@@ lock .
You end up f@@ loc@@ king with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interest@@ s .
And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other f@@ loc@@ ks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interest@@ s .
To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bu@@ mp you out of your f@@ lock and into another f@@ lock .
You need a gui@@ de .
So this is A@@ mira Al H@@ us@@ s@@ ain@@ i . She is the Middle East edi@@ tor for Global Vo@@ ices .
She has one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world .
Not only does she have to keep our Isra@@ el@@ i and Pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an contribu@@ tors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal or@@ bit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smo@@ king for the month of R@@ am@@ ad@@ an , she has to know something about a global audience .
She has to know something about what stories are available .
B@@ asi@@ cally , she &apos;s a de@@ ej@@ ay .
She &apos;s a sk@@ il@@ led human cur@@ ator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a sel@@ ection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorith@@ mic process .
I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for de@@ ej@@ ays to reach a wi@@ der audience .
I know A@@ mira .
I can ask her what to read .
But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web wid@@ en@@ ed .
So once you start wid@@ ening like this , once you start ligh@@ ting up voices in the dark spo@@ ts , once you start transl@@ ating , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really weird places .
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is A@@ fri@@ G@@ ad@@ get .
And A@@ fri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ack@@ s@@ mit@@ h in Ki@@ b@@ era in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i , who is turning the sha@@ ft of a L@@ and@@ ro@@ ver into a cold ch@@ is@@ el .
And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conc@@ ei@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;
And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
This is Eri@@ k Her@@ s@@ man . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
He goes by the mon@@ i@@ ker Whi@@ te African .
He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ ek , but he &apos;s also Ken@@ yan ; he was born in Sud@@ an , grew up in Kenya .
He is a bridge figure .
He is someone who literally has feet in both worl@@ ds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ack@@ s@@ mit@@ h in Ki@@ b@@ era and turn it into a story about rep@@ ur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about innov@@ ating from con@@ str@@ ain@@ t , about looking for inspir@@ ation based on re@@ using materials .
He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
These bridge figur@@ es , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wi@@ der through using the web .
But the tr@@ ick with bri@@ d@@ ges is , ultimately , you need someone to c@@ ross them .
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I sus@@ p@@ ect I would spend my of@@ f-@@ se@@ ason nur@@ sing my w@@ oun@@ ds , enjo@@ ying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recor@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m .
D@@ han@@ i J@@ ones , who is the middle lin@@ e@@ bac@@ ker for the C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ at@@ i B@@ eng@@ als , has a slightly different approach to the of@@ f-@@ se@@ ason .
D@@ han@@ i has a television show .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ han@@ i T@@ ack@@ les the G@@ lo@@ be . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , D@@ han@@ i trav@@ els to a different nation of the world .
He fin@@ ds a local s@@ port@@ ing team .
He tra@@ ins with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Mu@@ ay T@@ ha@@ i bo@@ x@@ ing .
It &apos;s because , for him , s@@ port is the language that allows him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full wid@@ th and wonder of the world .
For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
For a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or writing .
But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The goal of my Talk here is not to persu@@ ade the people in this room to embr@@ ace your x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ lia .
My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TED@@ Global — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les , whether or not you use that term .
My challenge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wi@@ der world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ wi@@ re the systems that we have .
We have to fix our media .
We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
We have to fix our im@@ migr@@ ation policy .
We need to look at ways of creating ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , of making transl@@ ation per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve , and we need to find ways to embr@@ ace and celebr@@ ate these bridge figur@@ es .
And we need to figure out how to cultiv@@ ate x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
B@@ asi@@ cally , there &apos;s a major dem@@ ographic event going on .
And it may be that pas@@ sing the 50 percent urban point is an economic ti@@ pping point . So the world now is a map of connec@@ tivity .
It used to be that Par@@ is and London and New York were the largest cities .
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ gate numbers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , vill@@ ages of the world are emp@@ t@@ ying out .
The question is , why ?
And here &apos;s the un@@ ro@@ man@@ tic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in R@@ en@@ ais@@ s@@ ance Germany . So some people go to places like S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ tics rule .
And these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by poverty .
They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
They &apos;re the domin@@ ant buil@@ ders and to a large ext@@ ent , the domin@@ ant designers .
They have home@@ -@@ bre@@ wed infrastructure and vibr@@ ant urban life .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ six@@ th of the GDP in India is coming out of Mu@@ mb@@ ai .
They are constantly up@@ grad@@ ing , and in a few cases , the government helps .
E@@ duc@@ ation is the main event that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the street in Mu@@ mb@@ ai ?
Al G@@ ore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no un@@ employ@@ ment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . Every@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ six@@ th of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first pun@@ ch line : cities have def@@ used the population bo@@ mb .
And here &apos;s the second pun@@ ch line .
That &apos;s the news from down@@ town . Here it is in perspective .
Star@@ s have sh@@ ined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
Now we &apos;re sh@@ ining right back up .
Thank you .
The night before I was head@@ ing for Scot@@ land , I was invited to ho@@ st the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Go@@ t Tal@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i with the 8@@ 0,000 live audience in the st@@ adi@@ um .
Gu@@ ess who was the perform@@ ing gu@@ est ?
S@@ usan Bo@@ yle .
And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She san@@ g beauti@@ fully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hel@@ lo &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
It means &quot; &quot; green oni@@ on for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
Because it was a line from our Chinese par@@ all@@ el S@@ usan Bo@@ yle — a 5@@ 0-@@ some year-old woman , a veget@@ able ven@@ dor in S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i , who lo@@ ves singing Western oper@@ a , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or It@@ ali@@ an , so she managed to fill in the ly@@ r@@ ics with veget@@ able names in Chinese .
( Laughter ) And the last sentence of N@@ ess@@ un D@@ or@@ ma that she was singing in the st@@ adi@@ um was &quot; &quot; green oni@@ on for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ usan Bo@@ yle was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live audience san@@ g together .
That was hi@@ l@@ ari@@ ous .
So I guess both S@@ usan Bo@@ yle and this veget@@ able ven@@ dor in S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i bel@@ on@@ ged to o@@ ther@@ ness .
They were the least expected to be successful in the business called enter@@ tain@@ ment , yet their cour@@ age and tal@@ ent brought them through .
And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
Well , being different is not that difficult .
We are all different from different perspec@@ tives .
But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
You may have the chance to make a difference .
My generation has been very fortun@@ ate to wit@@ ness and particip@@ ate in the histori@@ c transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
I remember that in the year of 199@@ 0 , when I was gradu@@ ating from college , I was ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job in the s@@ ales de@@ partment of the first fi@@ ve-@@ star hotel in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , Great Wall S@@ her@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there .
So after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this Jap@@ an@@ ese man@@ ager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Mis@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my cour@@ age and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clu@@ e what a s@@ ales de@@ partment was about in a fi@@ ve-@@ star hotel .
That was the first day I set my foot in a fi@@ ve-@@ star hotel .
A@@ round the same time , I was going through an audi@@ tion — the first ever open audi@@ tion by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
The produc@@ er told us they were looking for some swe@@ et , inno@@ c@@ ent and beautiful fresh face .
So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s person@@ alities on television always have to be beautiful , swe@@ et , inno@@ c@@ ent and , you know , sup@@ por@@ tive ?
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of of@@ fen@@ ded them .
But actually , they were impres@@ sed by my words .
And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
After seven ro@@ unds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
So I was on a national television pri@@ me@@ -@@ time show .
And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its ho@@ sts to speak out of their own minds without reading an appro@@ ved scrip@@ t .
( Applause ) And my wee@@ kly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia University to pur@@ su@@ e my post@@ graduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my career .
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vie@@ wed more than a thousand people in the past .
And sometimes I have young people appro@@ aching me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
But then we are also so fortun@@ ate to wit@@ ness the transformation of the whole country .
I was in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the O@@ ly@@ mpi@@ c G@@ ames .
I was represent@@ ing the S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i Ex@@ po .
I saw China embr@@ ac@@ ing the world and v@@ ice ver@@ sa .
But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
Well this is a girl called Gu@@ o M@@ ei@@ me@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful .
She showed off her expensive b@@ ags , clo@@ th@@ es and car on her micro@@ blog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
And she cl@@ aim@@ ed to be the general man@@ ager of R@@ ed C@@ ross at the Cha@@ mber of Com@@ mer@@ ce .
She didn &apos;t realize that she st@@ ep@@ ped on a sensitive ner@@ ve and ar@@ ous@@ ed national questi@@ oning , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the credi@@ bility of R@@ ed C@@ ross .
The contr@@ over@@ sy was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ ross had to open a press conference to cl@@ ari@@ fy it , and the investig@@ ation is going on .
So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that ti@@ tle — probably because she feels proud to be associated with char@@ ity .
All those expensive it@@ ems were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her bo@@ y@@ friend , who used to be a board mem@@ ber in a sub@@ divi@@ sion of R@@ ed C@@ ross at Cha@@ mber of Com@@ mer@@ ce .
It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
It is still bo@@ iling .
It shows us a general mi@@ str@@ ust of government or govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked institutions , which l@@ acked transpar@@ ency in the past .
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blog .
Micro@@ blog bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 2010 , with visi@@ tors dou@@ bled and time spent on it tri@@ pl@@ ed .
S@@ in@@ a@@ .com , a major news port@@ al , alone has more than 1@@ 40 million micro@@ b@@ log@@ gers .
On T@@ enc@@ ent , 200 million .
The most popular b@@ log@@ ger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million fol@@ lowers , or f@@ ans .
Ab@@ out 80 percent of those micro@@ b@@ log@@ gers are young people , under 30 years old .
And because , as you know , the traditional media is still he@@ avi@@ ly contro@@ lled by the government , social media offer@@ s an opening to let the ste@@ am out a little bit .
But because you don &apos;t have many other open@@ ings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
So through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging , we are able to understand Chinese y@@ outh even better .
So how are they different ?
First of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the one-@@ child policy .
And because of sel@@ ected abor@@ tion by families who fav@@ ored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
That could pose a potential dan@@ ger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ alized world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries .
Most of them have fairly good education .
The il@@ liter@@ acy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with se@@ ven@@ -@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 .
And you know we have the tradition that youn@@ ger generations support the el@@ ders financi@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to support four parents who have a life expect@@ ancy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
Col@@ le@@ ge gradu@@ ates are not in short supply .
In urban areas , college gradu@@ ates find the starting sal@@ ary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average r@@ ent is above $ 500 .
So what do they do ? They have to share space — s@@ que@@ e@@ zed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apart@@ ment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apart@@ ment .
That r@@ ati@@ o in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ eting real est@@ ate price .
A@@ mon@@ g the 200 million migr@@ ant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
They find themselves sort of sand@@ w@@ ich@@ ed between the urban areas and the rural areas .
Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of bel@@ on@@ ging .
They work for longer hours with less income , less social wel@@ f@@ are .
And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job lo@@ s@@ ses , subject to inf@@ l@@ ation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , appreci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ b@@ i , or dec@@ line of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
Last year , though , an ap@@ p@@ all@@ ing incid@@ ent in a sou@@ thern O@@ E@@ M manufactur@@ ing com@@ po@@ und in China : 13 young workers in their late te@@ ens and early 20@@ s commit@@ ted suici@@ de , just one by one like ca@@ using a cont@@ ag@@ i@@ ous disease .
But they died because of all different personal reasons .
But this whole incid@@ ent ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from society about the isol@@ ation , both physical and mental , of these migr@@ ant workers .
For those who do return back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very wel@@ come loc@@ ally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the as@@ sist@@ ance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , up@@ grade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
So for the past few years , the co@@ ast@@ al areas , they found themselves in a shor@@ t@@ age of labor .
These diagr@@ ams show a more general social background .
The first one is the En@@ g@@ els co@@ efficient , which expla@@ ins that the cost of daily neces@@ si@@ ties has dro@@ pped its perc@@ ent@@ age all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent .
But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , indic@@ ating a ri@@ sing living cost .
The G@@ in@@ i co@@ efficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income in@@ equality .
And so you see this whole society getting frustr@@ ated about losing some of its mo@@ bility .
And also , the bit@@ ter@@ ness and even res@@ ent@@ ment towards the rich and the powerful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad .
So any accu@@ s@@ ations of corruption or back@@ door de@@ al@@ ings between auth@@ ori@@ ties or business would ar@@ ouse a social out@@ cr@@ y or even un@@ rest .
So through some of the hot@@ test to@@ pic@@ s on micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging , we can see what young people care most about .
So@@ cial justice and government accoun@@ t@@ ability run@@ s the first in what they demand .
For the past decade or so , a massive urban@@ ization and development have let us wit@@ ness a lot of report@@ s on the forced demo@@ li@@ tion of private property .
And it has ar@@ ous@@ ed huge anger and frustr@@ ation among our young generation .
Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to prot@@ est .
So when these incid@@ ents are report@@ ed more and more frequ@@ ently on the Internet , people cr@@ y for the government to take actions to stop this .
So the good news is that earlier this year , the state coun@@ cil passed a new regul@@ ation on house requi@@ si@@ tion and demo@@ li@@ tion and passed the right to order forced demo@@ li@@ tion from local governments to the cour@@ t .
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly , many other issues concer@@ ning public safety is a hot topi@@ c on the Internet .
We heard about pollu@@ ted air , pollu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ oned food .
And guess what , we have fa@@ ked be@@ ef .
They have sorts of ingre@@ di@@ ents that you br@@ ush on a piece of chic@@ ken or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ ef .
And then l@@ ately , people are very concerned about coo@@ king oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; coo@@ king oil from restaurant s@@ lo@@ p .
So all these things have ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from the Internet .
And fortunately , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more ti@@ mely and also more frequ@@ ently to the public concer@@ ns .
Whi@@ le young people seem to be very sure about their particip@@ ation in public polic@@ y-@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
as the number one market for lu@@ x@@ ury br@@ ands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expen@@ di@@ tures in Europe and el@@ se@@ where .
But you know what , half of those consu@@ mers are ear@@ ning a sal@@ ary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
They &apos;re not rich at all .
They &apos;re taking those b@@ ags and clo@@ th@@ es as a sense of identity and social status .
And this is a girl expli@@ ci@@ tly saying on a TV dat@@ ing show that she would rather cr@@ y in a B@@ M@@ W than s@@ mile on a bic@@ y@@ cle .
But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ fer to s@@ mile , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a bic@@ y@@ cle .
So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; w@@ ed@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; marriage .
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the w@@ ed@@ ding , but it shows that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a di@@ am@@ ond ring and without a w@@ ed@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their commit@@ ment to true love .
And also , people are doing good through social media .
And the first picture showed us that a truc@@ k c@@ aging 500 hom@@ eless and kid@@ n@@ apped do@@ gs for food processing was spo@@ tt@@ ed and stopped on the high@@ way with the whole country watching through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging .
People were don@@ ating money , dog food and offer@@ ing volunte@@ er work to stop that truc@@ k .
And after hours of negoti@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were res@@ cu@@ ed .
And here also people are helping to find missing children .
A father pos@@ ted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
After thousands of res@@ ends in rel@@ ay , the child was found , and we wit@@ n@@ essed the reuni@@ on of the family through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging .
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
H@@ ap@@ p@@ iness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacri@@ fic@@ e our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
How are we going to per@@ form our social and political re@@ form to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustain@@ ability and st@@ ability ?
And also , how capable is the system of self-@@ correc@@ t@@ ness to keep more people content with all sorts of fric@@ tion going on at the same time ?
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transform@@ ed themselves .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And everyone changes as well .
You suddenly become a disease on legs .
And , it worked .
What are the out@@ comes ?
Everything I did was thou@@ ght@@ fully designed to get me eng@@ aged .
This global performance is my open@@ -@@ source cure for cancer .
A big challenge is , how should the iP@@ ads be used , and what ap@@ ps should we put on the iP@@ ads ?
H@@ i everybody . So my name is Ma@@ c .
My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re honest lies .
I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from P@@ ab@@ lo P@@ ic@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not truth .
Ar@@ t is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand .
The artist must know the man@@ ner wher@@ e@@ by to conv@@ ince others of the tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ness of his lies . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a kid , and I loved it , but I had no idea what it meant .
( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fic@@ tion and reality .
So how could I un@@ tan@@ g@@ le this k@@ not@@ ted bunch of s@@ enten@@ ces ?
And I said , I &apos;ve got Po@@ wer@@ Po@@ int . Let &apos;s do a Ven@@ n diagr@@ am .
&#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ th . Li@@ es . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , bo@@ om .
We &apos;ve got truth and lies and then there &apos;s this little space , the edge , in the middle .
That li@@ min@@ al space , that &apos;s art .
All right . Ven@@ n diagr@@ am . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very hel@@ p@@ ful either .
The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids .
I used to be a summer cam@@ p coun@@ sel@@ or .
I would do it on my sum@@ mers off from college , and I loved it .
It was a s@@ ports summer cam@@ p for four@@ - to six@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
I was in charge of the four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play s@@ ports , and ne@@ i@@ ther can I@@ .
( Laughter ) I play s@@ ports at a four@@ -year-old level , so what would happen is the kids would dri@@ bble around some con@@ es , and then got hot , and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life .
I would tell them about how , on the wee@@ k@@ ends , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Qu@@ een of England .
And soon , other kids who weren &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Ma@@ c Bar@@ net@@ t , right ?
You &apos;re the guy who spi@@ es for the Qu@@ een of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for str@@ angers to come up and ask me that question .
In my fantas@@ y , they were s@@ vel@@ te Rus@@ sian women , but , you know , four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , California .
And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
I think the pin@@ nac@@ le of this for me — I &apos;ll never forget this — there was this little girl named Ri@@ ley . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fru@@ it .
She would just take her fru@@ it , her mom pac@@ ked her a mel@@ on every day , and she would just throw it in the i@@ v@@ y and then she would eat fru@@ it sn@@ acks and pu@@ d@@ ding cu@@ ps , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Ri@@ ley , you can &apos;t do that , you have to eat the fru@@ it . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you throw the fru@@ it in the i@@ v@@ y , pretty soon , it &apos;s going to be over@@ grown with mel@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutri@@ tion@@ ist for children .
And so Ri@@ ley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of cam@@ p , I got up early and I got a big cant@@ al@@ ou@@ pe from the gro@@ cer@@ y store and I hi@@ d it in the i@@ v@@ y , and then at lun@@ ch@@ time , I was like , &quot; Ri@@ ley , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;
And — ( Laughter ) — she went tr@@ ud@@ ging through the i@@ v@@ y , and then her eyes just got so wide , and she pointed out this mel@@ on that was bigger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and r@@ ush@@ ed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; Hey , why is there a stic@@ ker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not throw your stic@@ kers in the i@@ v@@ y .
Pu@@ t them in the tras@@ h can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Ri@@ ley car@@ ried that mel@@ on around with her all day , and she was so proud .
And Ri@@ ley knew she didn &apos;t grow a mel@@ on in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion .
I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
It &apos;s what Col@@ er@@ id@@ ge called the willing suspen@@ sion of dis@@ belief or poe@@ tic faith , for those moments where a story , no matter how strange , has some sem@@ bl@@ ance of the truth , and then you &apos;re able to believe it .
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
A@@ dul@@ ts can too , and we get there when we read .
It &apos;s why in two days , people will be descen@@ ding on Du@@ bli@@ n to take the walking t@@ our of B@@ loo@@ m@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses , &quot; &quot; even though none of that happened .
Or people go to London and they visit B@@ aker Street to see S@@ her@@ lock H@@ ol@@ mes &apos; apart@@ ment , even though 2@@ 21@@ B is just a number that was pain@@ ted on a building that never actually had that address .
We know these characters aren &apos;t real , but we have real feelings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these characters aren &apos;t real ,
and yet we also know that they are .
Ki@@ ds can get there a lot more easily than adults can , and that &apos;s why I love writing for kids .
I think kids are the best audience for serious liter@@ ary fic@@ tion .
When I was a kid , I was obs@@ essed with secret door no@@ vel@@ s , things like &quot; &quot; N@@ ar@@ nia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ dro@@ be and go through to a mag@@ ical land .
And I was convinced that secret do@@ ors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
I wanted to live and c@@ ross over into that fic@@ tional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s clo@@ set do@@ ors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mom &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s clo@@ set , and there was not a secret mag@@ ical land there .
There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
After college , my first job was working behind one of these secret do@@ ors .
This is a place called 8@@ 26 Val@@ encia .
It &apos;s at 8@@ 26 Val@@ encia Street in the Mis@@ sion in San Francisco , and when I worked there , there was a publi@@ sh@@ ing company head@@ quar@@ tered there called Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s , a non@@ profit writing center called 8@@ 26 Val@@ encia , but then the front of it was a strange shop .
You see , this place was zon@@ ed re@@ tail , and in San Francisco , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the writ@@ er who foun@@ ded it , a writ@@ er named D@@ ave E@@ gg@@ ers , to come into compli@@ ance with code , he said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , I &apos;m just going to build a pi@@ rate supply store . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wood .
There &apos;s dra@@ wers you can pull out and get ci@@ tr@@ us so you don &apos;t get s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
They have ey@@ ep@@ at@@ ches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s spr@@ ing@@ time , pir@@ ates want to go wild .
You don &apos;t know . B@@ lack is bor@@ ing . P@@ ast@@ el .
Or eyes , also in lots of colors , just glass eyes , depen@@ ding on how you want to deal with that situation .
And the store , str@@ ang@@ ely , people came to them and bought things , and they ended up paying the r@@ ent for our tu@@ tor@@ ing center , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get instruc@@ tion in writing , and when you have to walk this weird , li@@ min@@ al , fic@@ tional space like this to go do your writing , it &apos;s going to affect the kind of work that you make .
It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
So I ran the 8@@ 26 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
So we have The E@@ cho Par@@ k Ti@@ me Tra@@ vel Mar@@ t .
That &apos;s our mot@@ to : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ enever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on S@@ un@@ set B@@ ou@@ lev@@ ard in Los Angeles .
Our friend@@ ly st@@ af@@ f is ready to help you .
They &apos;re from all eras , including just the 198@@ 0s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very recent past .
There &apos;s our Em@@ pl@@ oy@@ ees of the Mon@@ th , including Gen@@ gh@@ is K@@ han , Charles D@@ ick@@ ens .
Some great people have come up through our ran@@ ks .
This is our kind of ph@@ arm@@ acy section .
Our archit@@ ect was covered in red sy@@ r@@ up .
It looked like he had just mur@@ der@@ ed somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular archit@@ ect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
It was going to be the high@@ light of our store .
So we just put that sign on it that said , &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of order . Come back yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that ended up being a better jo@@ ke than sl@@ us@@ hi@@ es , so we just left it there forever .
M@@ am@@ mot@@ h Ch@@ un@@ ks . These things we@@ i@@ gh , like , seven pounds each .
Bar@@ b@@ arian re@@ pel@@ l@@ ent . It &apos;s full of sal@@ ad and pot@@ po@@ ur@@ r@@ i — things that bar@@ b@@ ari@@ ans hate .
De@@ ad languages .
( Laughter ) Le@@ ech@@ es , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
And Vi@@ king O@@ dor@@ ant , which comes in lots of great sc@@ ents : to@@ en@@ ails , swe@@ at and rot@@ ten veget@@ ables , p@@ y@@ re ash .
Because we believe that A@@ x@@ e Bo@@ dy S@@ pr@@ ay is something that you should only find on the b@@ att@@ le@@ field , not under your arms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emo@@ tion chi@@ ps , so robots can feel love or fear .
Our biggest sel@@ ler is S@@ cha@@ den@@ fre@@ u@@ de , which we did not expect .
( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
But there &apos;s a non@@ profit behind it , and kids go through a door that says &quot; &quot; Em@@ pl@@ oy@@ ees On@@ ly &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do home@@ work and write stories and make fil@@ ms and this is a book release party where kids will read .
There &apos;s a quar@@ ter@@ ly that &apos;s published with just writing that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have release parti@@ es and they eat ca@@ ke and read for their parents and drink mil@@ k out of cha@@ mp@@ ag@@ ne gl@@ as@@ ses .
And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
The jo@@ ke isn &apos;t a jo@@ ke .
You can &apos;t find the se@@ ams on the fic@@ tion , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fic@@ tion that &apos;s col@@ oniz@@ ed the real world .
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
There &apos;s a term called me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tion , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and meta &apos;s having a moment now .
I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 196@@ 0s with no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts like John Bar@@ th and Willi@@ am G@@ addi@@ s , but it &apos;s been around .
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ telling itself .
And one me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tive techni@@ que is bre@@ aking the fourth wall . Right ?
It &apos;s when an actor will turn to the audience and say , &quot; &quot; I am an actor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly honest moment , I would argue , is in service of the lie , but it &apos;s supposed to fore@@ ground the arti@@ fici@@ ality of the fic@@ tion .
For me , I kind of pre@@ fer the opposite .
If I &apos;m going to break down the fourth wall , I want fic@@ tion to escape and come into the real world .
I want a book to be a secret door that open@@ s and lets the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my books .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ ly Twit@@ ters and his Blu@@ e Wh@@ ale Pro@@ b@@ lem . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a kid who gets a blue wh@@ ale as a pet but it &apos;s a pun@@ ish@@ ment and it ru@@ ins his life .
So it &apos;s deli@@ vered over@@ night by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in San Francisco — very tough city to own a blue wh@@ ale in .
A lot of hi@@ lls , real est@@ ate is at a premi@@ um .
This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
But underneath the j@@ ack@@ et is this case , and that &apos;s the cover underneath the book , the j@@ ack@@ et , and there &apos;s an ad that offer@@ s a free 3@@ 0-@@ day ri@@ sk@@ -@@ free trial for a blue wh@@ ale .
And you can just send in a self-@@ addres@@ sed st@@ am@@ ped en@@ vel@@ op@@ e and we &apos;ll send you a wh@@ ale .
And kids do write in .
So here &apos;s a letter . It says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ear people , I bet you 10 bu@@ cks you won &apos;t send me a blue wh@@ ale .
E@@ li@@ ot G@@ an@@ n@@ on ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what E@@ li@@ ot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an law fir@@ m — ( Laughter ) — that says that due to a change in cust@@ oms laws , their wh@@ ale has been held up in So@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d , which is a very lo@@ v@@ ely f@@ j@@ or@@ d , and then it just kind of talks about So@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d and Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an food for a little while . It di@@ gr@@ esses . ( Laughter )
But it fin@@ ish@@ es off by saying that your wh@@ ale would love to hear from you .
He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
And when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the out@@ going message , it &apos;s just wh@@ ale sounds and then a be@@ ep , which actually sounds a lot like a wh@@ ale sound .
And they get a picture of their wh@@ ale too .
So this is R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h , and R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h bel@@ on@@ gs to a kid named N@@ ico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of N@@ ico &apos;s message .
This is the first message I ever got from N@@ ico .
( Audi@@ o ) N@@ ico : H@@ ello , this is N@@ ico .
I am your ow@@ ner , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h . H@@ ello .
So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . B@@ ye .
Ma@@ c Bar@@ net@@ t : So N@@ ico called back , like , an hour later .
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of N@@ ico &apos;s mess@@ ages .
( Audi@@ o ) N@@ ico : H@@ ello , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h , this is N@@ ico .
I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Satur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , yeah , Satur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hel@@ lo and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ ye .
M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again .
He &apos;s left over 25 mess@@ ages for R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h over four years .
You find out all about him and the grand@@ ma that he lo@@ ves and the grand@@ ma that he li@@ kes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the cros@@ s@@ word puzz@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more message from N@@ ico .
This is the Christ@@ mas message from N@@ ico .
&#91; Be@@ ep &#93; ( Audi@@ o ) N@@ ico : H@@ ello , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so bus@@ y because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a wh@@ ale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a mer@@ ry Christ@@ mas .
So have a nice Christ@@ mas , and b@@ y@@ e-@@ b@@ ye , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h . Go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
M@@ B : I actually got N@@ ico , I hadn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a message two days ago .
His voice is completely different , but he put his bab@@ y@@ si@@ tter on the phone , and she was very nice to R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h as well .
But N@@ ico &apos;s the best read@@ er I could hope for .
I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emo@@ tionally with the things that I create .
I feel lucky . Ki@@ ds like N@@ ico are the best read@@ ers , and they deser@@ ve the best stories we can give them .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . O@@ oh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; P@@ he@@ w , p@@ he@@ w , cal@@ m down . G@@ et back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) U@@ su@@ ally when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scre@@ am out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( V@@ v@@ v@@ w@@ ow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ a ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
Well , what I &apos;m doing is contro@@ lling the pit@@ ch with my left hand .
See , the closer I get to this an@@ ten@@ na , the higher the note gets — ( Por@@ tamento ) — and you can get it really low .
And with this hand I &apos;m contro@@ lling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the l@@ ou@@ der it gets .
( T@@ ones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re contro@@ lling pit@@ ch and volume and kind of trying to create the illu@@ sion that you &apos;re doing separate not@@ es , when really it &apos;s continu@@ ously going ...
( Fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh ... Be@@ ep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I star@@ tle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll le@@ an over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( B@@ li@@ p ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that fol@@ lo@@ ws you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tun@@ e , because I totally lost where this is going .
We &apos;re going to do a song by David M@@ ash called &quot; &quot; L@@ isten : the Wor@@ ds Are G@@ one , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me after@@ wards if I can rel@@ a@@ x .
( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are com@@ mon@@ ly asked ; there are so many .
And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ em@@ in .
It was invented around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the invent@@ or , L@@ é@@ on Th@@ er@@ em@@ in — he also was a mu@@ sici@@ an b@@ es@@ ides an invent@@ or — he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ em@@ in , I think , when he was working on some shor@@ tw@@ ave radi@@ os .
And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( S@@ cre@@ ech@@ ing ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instru@@ ment , because there are pit@@ ches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the ther@@ em@@ in the way it is now .
And a lot of times , even kids now@@ ad@@ ays , they &apos;ll make refer@@ ence to a ther@@ em@@ in by going , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the sci@@ -@@ f@@ i hor@@ ror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( W@@ o@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , go@@ of@@ y sound to do .
And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibr@@ ato gets out of hand .
You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its func@@ tions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
It re@@ minds me of the bal@@ ancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tun@@ e , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tun@@ e all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pit@@ ch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( T@@ one ri@@ sing out of key ) — and brea@@ thing will make it ...
( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
I think of it almost like like a y@@ o@@ ga instru@@ ment because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
And if I go to a clu@@ b and play a gi@@ g , people are like , &quot; Here , have some dr@@ in@@ ks on us ! &quot;
And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Te@@ e@@ ter@@ ing t@@ ones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does refl@@ ect the mo@@ od that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
it &apos;s similar to being a voc@@ alist , except instead of it coming out of your thro@@ at , you &apos;re contro@@ lling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of refer@@ ence ; you &apos;re always rel@@ ying on your ears and ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ing constantly .
You just have to always ad@@ just to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bu@@ m@@ mer not@@ es come here and there and listen to it , ad@@ just it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too ti@@ ed up and go crazy . Like me .
I think we will play another tun@@ e now .
I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; L@@ ush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tun@@ es to play .
( Music ) ( Applause )
But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impres@@ sion , but a l@@ asting one that rema@@ ins .
I was born in a family full of colors .
He was adop@@ ted by those who I know as my grand@@ parents .
The matri@@ arch , my grand@@ ma , has a por@@ cel@@ ain skin and co@@ tt@@ on-@@ like hair .
My grand@@ pa was somewhere between a van@@ illa and str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ry y@@ o@@ gur@@ t t@@ one , like my un@@ cle and my cou@@ sin .
My mother is a cin@@ nam@@ on-@@ skin daughter of a n@@ ative Braz@@ ili@@ an , with a pin@@ ch of ha@@ z@@ el and hon@@ ey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with mil@@ k , but with a lot of coffee .
She has two sist@@ ers .
( Laughter ) Gro@@ wing up in this family , color was never important for me .
O@@ u@@ t@@ side home , however , things were different soon .
Col@@ or had many other mean@@ ings .
I remember my first drawing les@@ sons in school as a bunch of contradic@@ tory feelings .
It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ colo@@ red p@@ enci@@ l .
I was made of fl@@ esh but I wasn &apos;t p@@ ink .
I was seven years old with a m@@ ess of colors in my head .
By helping in the kitch@@ en at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the ma@@ id .
I was even treated like a pro@@ stitu@@ te just because I was walking alone on the be@@ ach with European friends .
And many times , visi@@ ting my grand@@ ma or friends in up@@ per class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elev@@ ator .
Because in the end , with this color and this hair , I cannot bel@@ ong to some places .
Y@@ ears later I married a S@@ p@@ ani@@ ard .
But not any S@@ p@@ ani@@ ard .
I ch@@ ose one with the skin color of a lob@@ ster when sun@@ bur@@ n@@ t .
( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to cha@@ se me .
What will be the color of your children ?
But thinking about it , with my previ@@ ous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photograp@@ her .
Hu@@ man@@ ae is a pur@@ suit to high@@ light our true colors , rather than the un@@ true white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our co@@ des .
It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
I started with my family and friends , then more and more people jo@@ ined the ad@@ vent@@ ure , th@@ anks to public calls coming through the social media .
The s@@ now@@ ball started to roll .
The project had a great wel@@ come — invit@@ ations , exhibi@@ tions , physical for@@ mat@@ s , gall@@ eries and mus@@ eu@@ ms ...
just happened .
And among them , my favorite : when Hu@@ man@@ ae occu@@ pies public spaces and appe@@ ars in the street , it fo@@ sters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
I have por@@ tray@@ ed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
Just to men@@ tion some of them — from someone inclu@@ ded in the For@@ bes list , to refuge@@ es who cros@@ sed the Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean by boat .
All kinds of beli@@ efs , gender identi@@ ties or physical imp@@ air@@ ments , a new@@ born or termin@@ ally ill .
We all together build Hu@@ man@@ ae .
Those por@@ tra@@ its make us re@@ think how we see each other .
When modern science is questi@@ oning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
Sud@@ denly I realized that Hu@@ man@@ ae was useful for many people .
It repres@@ ents a sort of mir@@ ror for those who cannot find themselves refl@@ ected in any lab@@ el .
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
Per@@ haps we should stop .
Just to show you some examples , ill@@ us@@ trat@@ ors and art students using it as a refer@@ ence for their sk@@ et@@ ches and their studies .
It &apos;s a collection of faces .
And talking about foreign aff@@ airs , I found the perfect am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors for my project ...
teachers .
They are the ones that use Hu@@ man@@ ae as a tool for educ@@ ational pur@@ pos@@ es .
Their passion encour@@ ages me to go back to drawing clas@@ ses , but this time as a teacher myself .
My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-@@ por@@ tra@@ its , trying to discover their own unique color .
As a photograp@@ her , I realize that I can be a chan@@ nel for others to communicate .
As an individual , as An@@ g@@ éli@@ ca , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a ther@@ api@@ st .
becomes love .
The last country — the last country in the world who abo@@ li@@ shed s@@ la@@ very is the country where I was born , Brazil .
We still have to work hard to abo@@ li@@ sh dis@@ crimin@@ ation .
That rema@@ ins a common practice world@@ wide , and that will not dis@@ appear by itself .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I &apos;m very fortun@@ ate to be here .
I feel so fortun@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so impres@@ sed by the k@@ ind@@ ness expres@@ sed to me .
I called my wife L@@ es@@ lie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
It feels like I &apos;ve land@@ ed in a col@@ ony of ang@@ els . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my super@@ inten@@ d@@ ent .
H@@ er name is P@@ am Mor@@ an in Al@@ b@@ em@@ arle Coun@@ ty , Vir@@ gin@@ ia , the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ills of the Blu@@ e R@@ id@@ ge Moun@@ tains .
And she &apos;s a very high-@@ tech super@@ inten@@ d@@ ent .
She uses smart bo@@ ards , she blo@@ gs , she T@@ we@@ ets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-@@ tech stuff .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instruc@@ tional leader .
But in her office , there &apos;s this old wo@@ o@@ den , wea@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , kitch@@ en table — pe@@ el@@ ing green paint , it &apos;s kind of r@@ ick@@ ety .
And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a modern , cu@@ tt@@ ing@@ -@@ edge person .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Sou@@ th@@ w@@ estern Vir@@ gin@@ ia , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the farm@@ lands of rural Vir@@ gin@@ ia , and this table was in my grand@@ father &apos;s kitch@@ en .
And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plo@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insi@@ ghts and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it re@@ minds me of him .
It re@@ minds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame , and essentially it is also an empty space .
And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21@@ st century wisdom table , really .
It all started back in 197@@ 7 .
I was a young man , and I had been dro@@ pping in and out of college .
And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a my@@ stic@@ al qu@@ est .
And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flo@@ wing ro@@ bes and my big be@@ ard and my John L@@ en@@ n@@ on gl@@ as@@ ses — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spir@@ itual en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they ple@@ aded with me to get a degree in something .
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
It was an experim@@ ental education program .
It could have been d@@ enti@@ str@@ y , but the word &quot; &quot; experim@@ ental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
And I went in for a job inter@@ view in the Ric@@ h@@ mon@@ d Pu@@ bli@@ c S@@ cho@@ ols in Vir@@ gin@@ ia , the capital city , bought a three-@@ piece suit — my conc@@ es@@ sion to conven@@ tion — kept my long be@@ ard and my a@@ fr@@ o and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 7@@ 0s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an inter@@ view .
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the super@@ vis@@ or , her name was An@@ na Ar@@ o , said I had the job teaching gi@@ f@@ ted children .
And I was so sho@@ c@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gi@@ f@@ ted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer sho@@ c@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me .
H@@ er answer set the templ@@ ate for the entire career I was to have after that .
She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question clear@@ ed the space .
There was no program direc@@ tive , no man@@ ual to follow , no stand@@ ards in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way .
And she clear@@ ed such a space that I en@@ de@@ avo@@ red from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , wher@@ e@@ by they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
So this happened in 197@@ 8 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduc@@ ed me to a young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker .
His name is Chris F@@ ar@@ ina .
Chris F@@ ar@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visi@@ on@@ ary fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker who &apos;s made a film .
( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Pe@@ ace and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ements . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ posed the film to me — it &apos;s a great ti@@ tle .
He pro@@ posed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
Now it &apos;s still in deb@@ t , but Chris has managed , through his own sacri@@ fic@@ e , to get this film out .
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a test@@ am@@ ent to teaching and teachers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the e@@ eri@@ e sens@@ ation of seeing it — I saw myself literally dis@@ appear .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
I saw my geo@@ metry teacher in high school , Mr. R@@ uc@@ ell &apos;s wr@@ y s@@ mile under his hand@@ le@@ bar mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he .
That &apos;s the s@@ mile I use — that &apos;s his s@@ mile .
I saw J@@ an Po@@ lo &apos;s fl@@ ash@@ ing eyes .
And they weren &apos;t fl@@ ash@@ ing in anger , they were fl@@ ash@@ ing in love , inten@@ se love for her students .
And I have that kind of fl@@ ash sometimes .
And I saw Mis@@ s E@@ th@@ el J@@ . Ban@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ ls and high-@@ he@@ els to elem@@ ent@@ ary school every day .
And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school teacher st@@ are .
You know the one .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
And Mis@@ s Ban@@ ks was there as a great ment@@ or for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inv@@ enti@@ ve , sp@@ ati@@ al thin@@ ker .
That &apos;s my brother Mal@@ col@@ m there on the right .
And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated schools in Vir@@ gin@@ ia , who was my inspir@@ ation .
And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a g@@ est@@ ure she does , like this — I feel like I am a continu@@ ation of her g@@ est@@ ure .
I am one of her teaching g@@ est@@ ures .
And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elem@@ ent@@ ary school , M@@ adel@@ ine .
And so that g@@ est@@ ure of my mother &apos;s continu@@ es through many generations .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lin@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoul@@ ders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame I &apos;d like to tell you about .
It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four@@ -@@ foot by fi@@ ve-@@ foot pl@@ ywood board in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city urban school , 197@@ 8 .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
I didn &apos;t want to lec@@ ture or have just book reading .
I wanted to have them be im@@ mer@@ sed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interac@@ tive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 197@@ 8 — but something interac@@ tive .
And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four@@ -@@ foot by four@@ -@@ foot by four@@ -@@ foot Ple@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ ass structure .
And it has four Ple@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ ass lay@@ ers .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space layer with black holes and satelli@@ tes and research satelli@@ tes and astero@@ id min@@ ing .
There &apos;s an air and space level with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ ff@@ s of co@@ tton we push around and territ@@ ori@@ al air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an under@@ sea level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ sea min@@ ing .
There are four countries around the board .
The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
They have different as@@ sets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cab@@ in@@ et .
There &apos;s a Pri@@ me Min@@ ister , Sec@@ re@@ tary of S@@ tate , Min@@ ister of D@@ ef@@ ense and a C@@ F@@ O , or Com@@ p@@ tro@@ ll@@ er .
I choose the Pri@@ me Min@@ ister based on my relationship with them .
I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cab@@ in@@ et .
There &apos;s a World B@@ ank , arms de@@ al@@ ers and a United N@@ ations .
There &apos;s also a weather go@@ d@@ des@@ s who contr@@ ols a random st@@ ock market and random weather .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ page crisis docu@@ ment with 50 inter@@ loc@@ king problems .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
I throw them into this complex matri@@ x , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
And so with all these cri@@ ses , we have — let &apos;s see — eth@@ ni@@ c and min@@ ority ten@@ sions ; we have chemical and nuclear spi@@ lls , nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation .
There &apos;s oil spi@@ lls , environmental dis@@ ast@@ ers , water rights dis@@ pu@@ tes , break@@ away re@@ public@@ s , fam@@ ine , end@@ an@@ ger@@ ed species and global warming .
If Al G@@ ore is here , I &apos;m going to send my four@@ th-@@ grad@@ ers from A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and Ven@@ able schools to you because they sol@@ ved global warming in a week .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
So I also have in the game a sab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur — some child — it &apos;s basically a trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker — and I have my trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ mine everything in the game .
And they do it secre@@ tly through mis@@ information and ambi@@ gui@@ ties and ir@@ relev@@ anci@@ es , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
The sab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur is there , and we also read from Sun T@@ z@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of War . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th-@@ grad@@ ers understand it — nine years old — and they hand@@ le that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and destruc@@ tion , the path to war .
They learn to over@@ look shor@@ t-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted reac@@ tions and impul@@ sive thinking , to think in a long-@@ term , more consequ@@ ential way .
Ste@@ war@@ t Br@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a Co@@ E@@ volu@@ tion Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly article on a peace force .
And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
I &apos;m just a clock wat@@ ch@@ er .
I &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ er . I &apos;m just a facili@@ t@@ ator .
The students run the game .
I have no chance to make any policy what@@ so@@ ever once they start playing .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( Video ) B@@ oy : The World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame is serious .
You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
See , Mr. H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
John H@@ un@@ ter : I offer@@ ed them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
And I ad@@ mit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the answer .
And so I apo@@ logi@@ ze to them as well .
I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a s@@ inc@@ ere apo@@ logy , and they take it very seriously .
Now you may be wonder@@ ing what all this complexity looks like .
Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
( Video ) J@@ H : All right , we &apos;re going into negoti@@ ations as of now . Go .
( Cha@@ tter ) J@@ H : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that class@@ room ?
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
I &apos;ve learned to c@@ ede control of the class@@ room over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedic@@ ation to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the class@@ room .
It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I ad@@ mit it to them open@@ ly .
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some mag@@ ical things that have happened .
In this game we had a little girl , and she was the D@@ ef@@ ense Min@@ ister of the po@@ or@@ est nation .
And the D@@ ef@@ ense Min@@ ister — she had the t@@ ank cor@@ ps and A@@ ir For@@ ce and so forth .
And she was next door to a very we@@ al@@ thy , o@@ il@@ -@@ rich neighb@@ or .
Wi@@ th@@ out provoc@@ ation , suddenly she att@@ acked , against her Pri@@ me Min@@ ister &apos;s orders , the n@@ ex@@ t-@@ door neighb@@ or &apos;s oil fields .
She mar@@ ched into the oil field reser@@ ves , surro@@ unded it , without fir@@ ing a shot , and secu@@ red it and held it .
And that neighb@@ or was un@@ able to conduc@@ t any military oper@@ ations because their fuel supply was loc@@ ked up .
We were all up@@ set with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
This is the World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that .
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to c@@ ross a nine year-old girl with tan@@ ks .
( Laughter ) They are the tou@@ gh@@ est op@@ pon@@ ents .
And we were very up@@ set .
I thought I was fail@@ ing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negoti@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negoti@@ ation period with all te@@ ams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negoti@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military of@@ fen@@ sive to domin@@ ate the entire world .
H@@ ad they had their fuel sup@@ pli@@ es , they would have done it .
She was able to see the v@@ ect@@ ors and tr@@ end lines and inten@@ tions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosoph@@ ical decision to attack in a peace game .
Now she used a small war to aver@@ t a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosoph@@ ical discus@@ sion about whether that was right , condi@@ tional good , or not right .
That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situ@@ ations .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spon@@ tane@@ ously through their collective wisdom .
( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
If you &apos;re a military com@@ man@@ der and you w@@ age tro@@ op@@ s — the little plastic to@@ ys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
You have to write a letter to their parents — the fic@@ tional parents of your fic@@ tional tro@@ op@@ s — expla@@ ining what happened and offer@@ ing your con@@ do@@ len@@ ces .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to comb@@ at .
And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t School in Al@@ b@@ em@@ arle Coun@@ ty — and one of our military com@@ man@@ ders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent visi@@ ting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more real@@ er if she re@@ ads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gam@@ ely picked up the letter .
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
She read two s@@ enten@@ ces .
By the third sentence , she was in t@@ ears .
I was in t@@ ears .
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the win@@ ners are not glo@@ ating .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing oc@@ curr@@ ence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many b@@ att@@ les .
( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people att@@ ac@@ king .
I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun T@@ z@@ u said one week .
One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into b@@ attle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in b@@ attle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been win@@ ning b@@ att@@ les , so I &apos;m going into b@@ att@@ les , more b@@ att@@ les .
And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun T@@ z@@ u said .
J@@ H : I get chil@@ ls every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of eng@@ agement you want to have happen .
And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
But it &apos;s self-@@ evid@@ ent ass@@ ess@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an auth@@ enti@@ c ass@@ ess@@ ment of learning .
We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ ren@@ n@@ an .
We had played the game one ses@@ sion after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially sol@@ ved all 50 of the inter@@ loc@@ king cri@@ ses .
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s as@@ set value has to be increas@@ ed above its starting point .
Some are poor , some are we@@ al@@ thy . There are billions .
The World B@@ ank president was a thir@@ d-@@ grad@@ er one time .
He says , &quot; &quot; How many z@@ eros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calcul@@ ate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fi@@ sc@@ al policy in that game for high school play@@ ers who were playing with him .
So the team that was the po@@ or@@ est had gotten even po@@ ore@@ r .
There was no way they could win .
And we were appro@@ aching four o &apos;@@ clock , our cu@@ t-@@ off time — there was about a minute left — and des@@ pair just sett@@ led over the room .
I thought , I &apos;m fail@@ ing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be fail@@ ing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dej@@ ected .
And suddenly , B@@ ren@@ n@@ an walked over to my chair and he grab@@ bed the b@@ ell , the b@@ ell I ring to signal a change or a re@@ conven@@ ing of cab@@ in@@ ets , and he ran back to his seat , ran@@ g the b@@ ell .
Everybody ran to his chair : there was scre@@ aming ; there was yel@@ ling , w@@ aving of their do@@ s@@ si@@ ers .
They get these do@@ s@@ si@@ ers full of secret docu@@ ments .
They were gesti@@ cul@@ ating ; they were running around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my class@@ room .
Pr@@ inci@@ p@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And B@@ ren@@ n@@ an run@@ s back to his seat . Everybody run@@ s back to their seat .
He r@@ ings the b@@ ell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to offer it as a don@@ ation to this poor country .
And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their as@@ set value and we can win the game .
W@@ ill you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
Everybody looks at this prime min@@ ister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
S@@ pon@@ tane@@ ous compassion that could not be plan@@ ned for , that was un@@ expected and un@@ predic@@ table .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
Some games are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to den@@ y them that reality of being human .
I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloo@@ d@@ less way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and le@@ ver@@ age something good for the world , they may save us all .
If only .
And on be@@ half of all of my teachers on whose shoul@@ ders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
He lives in a small village in sou@@ thern S@@ om@@ alia .
His village is near Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
D@@ r@@ ought dri@@ ves the small village into poverty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ v@@ ation .
With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the capital of S@@ om@@ alia .
When he arri@@ ves , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
He ends up living in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
Maybe a year pas@@ ses , nothing .
One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ached by a gentlem@@ an who offer@@ s to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to break@@ fast .
He me@@ ets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clo@@ th@@ es , money to send back home to his family .
He is introduc@@ ed to this young woman .
He eventually gets married .
He starts this new life .
He has a purpose in life .
One beautiful day in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , under an az@@ ure blue sky , a car bo@@ mb goes off .
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suici@@ de bomb@@ er , and that dynamic group of people were al S@@ hab@@ a@@ a@@ b , a terror@@ ist organization lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ eda .
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing himself up ?
He was waiting .
He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
This was the first thing that pu@@ lled him out of what we call w@@ ai@@ th@@ ood .
And his story repe@@ ats itself in urban centers around the world .
It is the story of the dis@@ enfr@@ an@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , un@@ employ@@ ed urban y@@ outh who s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in Jo@@ han@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g , s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in London , who re@@ aches out for something other than w@@ ai@@ th@@ ood .
For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosper@@ ity of their cities .
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ outh who suf@@ fer from the highest un@@ employ@@ ment rates .
By 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of w@@ ai@@ th@@ ood , the g@@ ate@@ way to terrorism , to violence , to gan@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2.@@ 0 .
And in my city of birth , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , 70 percent of young people suf@@ fer from un@@ employ@@ ment .
70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
They pretty much do nothing .
I went back to Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u last month , and I went to visit Mad@@ ina Ho@@ sp@@ ital , the hospital I was born in .
I remember standing in front of that bu@@ lle@@ t-@@ ri@@ dden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
What if I had been forced into that same state of w@@ ai@@ th@@ ood ?
Would I have become a terror@@ ist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u that month was actually to ho@@ st a y@@ outh leadership and entreprene@@ ur@@ ship sum@@ mit .
I brought together about 90 young S@@ om@@ al@@ i leaders .
We sat down and br@@ ain@@ stor@@ med on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
He went to university in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , gradu@@ ated .
There were no jobs , no opportunities .
I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , un@@ employ@@ ed , frustr@@ ated , that he was the perfect target for al S@@ hab@@ a@@ a@@ b and other terror@@ ist organizations , to be rec@@ ru@@ ited .
They s@@ ought people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
In Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the biggest barri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
Tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of civil war have completely destro@@ yed the road system , and a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the easi@@ est way to get around .
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ ized it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He began r@@ ent@@ ing out mot@@ or@@ bi@@ kes to local resid@@ ents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
He bought 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually exp@@ and to several hundred within the next three years .
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identify and se@@ ize a new opportunity .
It &apos;s entreprene@@ ur@@ ship , and I believe entreprene@@ ur@@ ship can be the most powerful tool against w@@ ai@@ th@@ ood .
It em@@ po@@ wers young people to be the cre@@ ators of the very economic opportunities they are so desper@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can train young people to be entreprene@@ urs .
I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , Mo@@ ha@@ med Mo@@ ham@@ oud , a fl@@ or@@ ist .
He was helping me train some of the young people at the sum@@ mit in entreprene@@ ur@@ ship and how to be innov@@ ative and how to create a culture of entreprene@@ ur@@ ship .
He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mo@@ ha@@ med came along , if you wanted f@@ lowers at your w@@ ed@@ ding , you used plastic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pped from ab@@ road .
If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh f@@ lowers ? &quot;
for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ ha@@ med saw an opportunity .
He started a lands@@ cap@@ ing and design fl@@ oral company .
He created a farm right outside of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ lies , which he said could survive the har@@ sh Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u climate .
And he began deli@@ vering f@@ lowers to w@@ ed@@ dings , creating gar@@ den@@ s at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
There &apos;s no public park in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ ses .
And he doesn &apos;t grow ro@@ ses because they use too much water , by the way .
So the first step is to inspi@@ re young people , and in that room , Mo@@ ha@@ med &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really profound impact on the y@@ outh in that room .
They had never really thought about starting up a business .
They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
He em@@ powered them to believe that they could be entreprene@@ urs , that they could be change makers .
By the end of the day , they were coming up with innov@@ ative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
They came up with entreprene@@ uri@@ al solutions to local problems .
So inspir@@ ing young people and creating a culture of entreprene@@ ur@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and ment@@ or@@ ship to gui@@ de them in developing and laun@@ ching their businesses .
Con@@ nec@@ t young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ide@@ ation to creation , and you will create cat@@ al@@ y@@ sts for urban growth .
For me , entreprene@@ ur@@ ship is more than just starting up a business .
It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
Mo@@ ha@@ med is not simply selling f@@ lowers .
I believe he is selling hope .
His Pe@@ ace Par@@ k , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
A@@ den hi@@ red street kids to help r@@ ent out and main@@ tain those bi@@ kes for him .
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paral@@ y@@ sis of w@@ ai@@ th@@ ood .
These young entreprene@@ urs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
So my sugg@@ estion is , turn y@@ outh into entreprene@@ urs , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and nur@@ ture their inher@@ ent innovation , and you will have more stories of f@@ lowers and Pe@@ ace Par@@ ks than of car bomb@@ s and w@@ ai@@ th@@ ood .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s wel@@ come Mr. J@@ ami@@ re Willi@@ ams on the dru@@ ms , ( Applause ) Bur@@ n@@ is@@ s Tra@@ v@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christi@@ an S@@ ands on the piano . ( Applause )
So the band@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
It is really a sac@@ red space .
And one of the things that is really sac@@ red about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the band@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Tit@@ i Bo@@ om . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
Every@@ one &apos;s listening . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for proj@@ ected ideas .
So the idea of a mist@@ ake : From the perspective of a j@@ az@@ z mu@@ sici@@ an , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mist@@ ake .
So the way I percei@@ ve a mist@@ ake when I &apos;m on the band@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mist@@ ake .
The only mist@@ ake lies in that I &apos;m not able to percei@@ ve what it is that someone else did .
Every &quot; &quot; mist@@ ake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in j@@ az@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a pal@@ et@@ te , that so@@ unded like this ...
( Music ) So if Christi@@ an played a note — like play an F@@ . ( Music )
See , these are all right inside of the color pal@@ et@@ te .
If you played an E@@ .
See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional pal@@ et@@ te that we were painting .
If you played an F # though , ( Dis@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would percei@@ ve that as a mist@@ ake .
So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ et@@ te .
And at some point , Christi@@ an will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t re@@ act to it .
He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this pal@@ et@@ te .
( Music ) So someone could concep@@ tually percei@@ ve that as a mist@@ ake .
The only way that I would say it was a mist@@ ake is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opportunity that was mis@@ sed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table . We &apos;ll paint this pal@@ et@@ te again .
He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a mel@@ o@@ dy out of it .
The tex@@ ture changed in the dru@@ ms this time .
It got a little bit more rhyth@@ mic , a little bit more inten@@ se in response to how I respon@@ ded to it .
So there is no mist@@ ake .
The only mist@@ ake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual mu@@ sici@@ an is not aware and accep@@ ting enough of his fellow band mem@@ ber to incorpor@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
So j@@ az@@ z , this band@@ stand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very p@@ uri@@ fying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gr@@ ant@@ ed .
We know that to be able to come on the band@@ stand and play music is a bl@@ essing .
So how does this all rel@@ ate to behavi@@ oral fin@@ ance ?
Well we &apos;re j@@ az@@ z mu@@ sici@@ ans , so ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pic@@ ally we don &apos;t have a great relationship to fin@@ ance .
( Laughter ) Any@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we hand@@ le it .
And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micro@@ manage in j@@ az@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually lim@@ its the arti@@ stic possibilities .
If I come up and I dic@@ tate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ o@@ tic because I &apos;m bu@@ ll@@ ying my ideas .
I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
This is a science of listening .
It has far more to do with what I can percei@@ ve than what it is that I can do .
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensi@@ ty , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
When you do that , you engage and inspi@@ re the other mu@@ sici@@ ans and they give you more , and grad@@ ually it buil@@ ds .
W@@ atch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
( Music ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pu@@ lling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nu@@ anced .
It &apos;s not about bu@@ ll@@ ying my vision or anything like that .
It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accep@@ ting one another and allo@@ wing creativity to flow .
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innov@@ ate fundament@@ ally in education .
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ all@@ ed to in education .
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible spe@@ ech@@ es and ideas that are being spread , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
So most everyone wat@@ ches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
The average American wat@@ ches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , ber@@ ate it .
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idi@@ ot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a con@@ science .
So why I believe that television has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that television directly refl@@ ects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ate our entire value system .
So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all add up to our idea of con@@ science .
Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We &apos;re talking about top@@ -@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over the course of 50 years .
How do these Ni@@ el@@ s@@ en rat@@ ings refl@@ ect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective un@@ conscious , but how do these top@@ -@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over 50 years refl@@ ect the idea of our social con@@ science ?
How does television evol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , including humans , have four basic prim@@ al inst@@ inc@@ ts .
You have hun@@ ger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ quisi@@ tiv@@ eness .
As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to t@@ emp@@ er , or t@@ ame , these basic animal inst@@ inc@@ ts .
We have the capacity to lau@@ gh and cr@@ y .
We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity .
That is separate and apart from the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be enter@@ tain@@ ed .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separ@@ ates us from the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
An@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
So I had an ambi@@ tion to discover what could be understood from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
Why has television enter@@ tain@@ ment evolved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this carto@@ on de@@ vil or ang@@ el sitting on our shoul@@ ders .
Is television literally func@@ tion@@ ing as our con@@ science , t@@ emp@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?
So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
We went back 50 years to the 195@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 television se@@ ason .
We surve@@ yed the top@@ -@@ 20 Ni@@ el@@ s@@ en shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3@@ ,@@ 600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emo@@ tionally .
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity ?
Did you feel ou@@ tr@@ age ? Did you lau@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So to our global TED audi@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sam@@ ple .
But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
And on a f@@ actual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are ex@@ port@@ ed around the world .
So I really hope our global audi@@ ences can rel@@ ate .
Two ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data slide : For inspir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tr@@ icks that con@@ science can play on us on a daily basis , I thank le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y rab@@ b@@ i , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n .
And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community super@@ star H@@ ans Ros@@ ling , who you may have just seen .
Okay , here we go .
So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspir@@ ation state and the moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspir@@ ation as television shows that u@@ pli@@ ft me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
M@@ oral ambi@@ gu@@ ity are televi@@ sions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 inspir@@ ation is holding ste@@ ady .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
M@@ oral ambi@@ gu@@ ity starts to cli@@ mb .
Right at the end of the 6@@ 0s , moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , inspir@@ ation is kind of on the w@@ ane .
Why ?
The Cu@@ ban Mis@@ si@@ le C@@ ri@@ sis , J@@ F@@ K is shot , the Ci@@ vil Ri@@ ghts movement , race ri@@ ots , the Vi@@ et@@ n@@ am War , M@@ L@@ K is shot , B@@ ob@@ by Ken@@ ne@@ dy is shot , Wat@@ erg@@ ate .
Look what happens .
In 19@@ 70 , inspir@@ ation plu@@ m@@ me@@ ts .
M@@ oral ambi@@ gu@@ ity takes off .
They c@@ ross , but R@@ on@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an , a tele@@ geni@@ c president , is in office .
It &apos;s trying to reco@@ ver .
But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tra , the Ch@@ allen@@ ger dis@@ aster , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l .
M@@ oral ambi@@ gu@@ ity becomes the domin@@ ant mem@@ e in television from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This char@@ t is going to docu@@ ment a very similar tr@@ end .
But in this case , we have comfor@@ t — the bu@@ bble in red — social com@@ ment@@ ary and ir@@ rever@@ ence in blue and green .
Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ anza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have dom@@ esti@@ c shows all about comfor@@ t .
This is ri@@ sing . Com@@ for@@ t st@@ ays whole .
Ir@@ rever@@ ence starts to rise .
So@@ cial com@@ ment@@ ary is all of a sudden spi@@ king up .
You get to 196@@ 9 , and look what happens .
You have comfor@@ t , ir@@ rever@@ ence , and social com@@ ment@@ ary , not only b@@ att@@ ling it out in our society , but you literally have two establi@@ sh@@ ment shows — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ yle &quot; &quot; — in 196@@ 9 are the nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ three-@@ r@@ ated television shows .
What &apos;s number one ?
The soci@@ ally ir@@ rever@@ ent hi@@ p@@ pie show , &quot; Ro@@ w@@ an and Martin &apos;s L@@ au@@ gh@@ -@@ In . &quot;
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Vi@@ e@@ wers had respon@@ ded dram@@ atically .
Look at this green spi@@ ke in 196@@ 6 to a bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show .
When you guys hear this industry term , a break@@ out hit , what does that mean ?
It means in the 196@@ 6 television se@@ ason , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mothers Bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where .
This was the first show that allowed vie@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the Vi@@ et@@ n@@ am War , about the presid@@ ency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a break@@ out show .
So then , just like the last char@@ t , look what happens .
In 19@@ 70 , the dam bur@@ sts . The dam bur@@ sts .
Com@@ for@@ t is no longer why we watch television .
So@@ cial com@@ ment@@ ary and ir@@ rever@@ ence rise throughout the 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this .
The 7@@ 0s means who ? Nor@@ man L@@ ear .
You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ ami@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ ford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the domin@@ ant show — in the top@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 7@@ 0s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ran@@ ked most highly for ir@@ rever@@ ence appeared on air during the Vi@@ et@@ n@@ am War , five of the top@@ -@@ 10 during the Ni@@ x@@ on administr@@ ation .
On@@ ly one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
So to this very , very sav@@ v@@ y crow@@ d , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disrup@@ tive .
Ar@@ chi@@ e B@@ un@@ ker was sho@@ ved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
This is a quick char@@ t . Here &apos;s another at@@ tribu@@ te : fantas@@ y and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday real@@ m &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ma@@ pped against the red do@@ t , un@@ employ@@ ment , which is a simple Bu@@ re@@ au of L@@ ab@@ or De@@ partment stati@@ stic .
You &apos;ll see that every time fantas@@ y and imagination shows rise , it ma@@ ps to a spi@@ ke in un@@ employ@@ ment .
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being un@@ employ@@ ed ?
No . In the 7@@ 0s you have the bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ onic Wom@@ an &quot; &quot; that ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ed into the top@@ -@@ 10 in 197@@ 3 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Si@@ x M@@ illi@@ on-@@ Do@@ ll@@ ar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Char@@ lie &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; Another spi@@ ke in the 198@@ 0s — another spi@@ ke in shows about control and power .
What were those shows ?
G@@ lam@@ or@@ ous and rich .
&quot; D@@ allas , &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ y Is@@ land . &quot;
In@@ credi@@ ble ma@@ pping of our national psy@@ che with some hard and fast facts : un@@ employ@@ ment .
So here you are , in my favorite char@@ t , because this is our last 20 years .
W@@ he@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my business , you have su@@ rely heard or read of the dec@@ line of the thing called the three-@@ camera si@@ t@@ com and the rise of reality TV .
Well , as we say in the business , X mar@@ ks the spot .
The 9@@ 0s — the big bu@@ b@@ bles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Fri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ra@@ si@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Che@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ el@@ d . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low un@@ employ@@ ment .
But look : X mar@@ ks the spot .
In 2001 , the Sep@@ tem@@ ber 2001 television se@@ ason , humor suc@@ cu@@ mb@@ s to jud@@ g@@ ment once and for all .
Why not ?
We had a 2000 pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tion decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ st@@ ing of the tech bu@@ bble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x becomes part of the social le@@ xi@@ con .
Look what happens when we keep going .
At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
What do people want in their TV then ?
I would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
Gi@@ ve me some comfor@@ t ; my world is fall@@ ing apart .
No , they want jud@@ g@@ ment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sar@@ ah Pal@@ in &apos;s daughter d@@ ancing .
I can choose the next American I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fi@@ red .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
So as dram@@ atically different as these television shows , p@@ ure enter@@ tain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic inst@@ inct rema@@ ins .
We &apos;re animals , we need our mo@@ ms .
There has not been a decade of television without a defini@@ tive , domin@@ ant TV mom .
The 195@@ 0s : J@@ une C@@ le@@ ever in the original comfor@@ t show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ ave it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; Lu@@ cil@@ le B@@ all kept us laugh@@ ing through the rise of social consciousness in the 6@@ 0s .
M@@ au@@ de F@@ ind@@ lay , the ep@@ it@@ o@@ me of the ir@@ rever@@ ent 197@@ 0s , who t@@ ack@@ led abor@@ tion , di@@ vor@@ ce , even men@@ op@@ ause on TV .
The 198@@ 0s , our first cou@@ gar was given to us in the form of Alex@@ is C@@ arr@@ ington .
M@@ ur@@ ph@@ y Bro@@ wn took on a v@@ ice president when she took on the idea of single par@@ en@@ th@@ ood .
This era &apos;s mom , B@@ ree Van de K@@ am@@ p .
Now I don &apos;t know if this is the de@@ vil or the ang@@ el sitting on our con@@ science , sitting on television &apos;s shoul@@ ders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
So to you all , the women of TED@@ Women , the men of TED@@ Women , the global audi@@ ences of TED@@ Women , thank you for le@@ tting me present my idea about the con@@ science of television .
But let me also thank the incredible cre@@ ators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television scre@@ ens throughout all these ages of television .
They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ wers , through your collective social consci@@ ences , that give it life , long@@ ev@@ ity , power or not .
So th@@ anks very much .
( Applause )
Well we all know the World Wi@@ de Web has absolutely transform@@ ed publi@@ sh@@ ing , broad@@ c@@ asting , commer@@ ce and social connec@@ tivity , but where did it all come from ?
And I &apos;ll quote three people : V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar Bush , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t and Ti@@ m Ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ Le@@ e .
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar Bush .
V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chi@@ ef scientific ad@@ vi@@ ser during the war .
And in 19@@ 45 , he published an article in a magazine called At@@ lan@@ tic Mon@@ th@@ ly .
And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We M@@ ay Think . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
We don &apos;t work in terms of libr@@ aries and cat@@ alo@@ g systems and so forth .
The brain works by associ@@ ation .
With one it@@ em in its thought , it sn@@ aps inst@@ antly to the next it@@ em .
And the way information is struc@@ tured is totally in@@ capable of keeping up with this process .
And so he sugg@@ ested a machine , and he called it the mem@@ e@@ x .
And the mem@@ e@@ x would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
Now this was in 19@@ 45 .
A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code bre@@ aking .
And nobody knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was invented .
And he pro@@ posed this machine called the mem@@ e@@ x .
And he had a platform where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
So sp@@ in@@ ning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t , and he was a U.S. A@@ ir For@@ ce offic@@ er .
And he was reading it in their libr@@ ary in the F@@ ar East .
And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of direc@@ ted the rest of his life .
And by the mid@@ -@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Res@@ ear@@ ch La@@ b in California .
He built a system .
The system was designed to au@@ g@@ ment human intelligence , it was called .
And in a pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tion of today &apos;s world of cloud compu@@ ting and sof@@ tw@@ ares of service , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine Sy@@ stem .
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t .
He was giving a present@@ ation at the F@@ all Jo@@ int Com@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ fer@@ ence in 196@@ 8 .
What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstr@@ ated this system .
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
And you can see , he &apos;s working between docu@@ ments and graph@@ ics and so forth .
And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a fi@@ ve-@@ finger ke@@ y@@ board and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he speci@@ ally designed in order to do this system .
So this is where the mouse came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t .
The trouble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal j@@ et plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very prac@@ tical .
But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when personal computers did arri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called Gu@@ i@@ de for the Apple M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ sh .
And we deli@@ vered the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ text system .
And this began to get a head of ste@@ am .
Apple introduc@@ ed a thing called Hy@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a f@@ us@@ s about it .
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ page sup@@ pl@@ ement in the Wall Street J@@ our@@ n@@ al the day it launched .
The mag@@ az@@ ines started to cover it .
B@@ y@@ te magazine and Com@@ mun@@ ic@@ ations at the A@@ C@@ M had special issues co@@ vering hy@@ per@@ text .
We developed a P@@ C version of this product as well as the M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ sh version .
And our P@@ C version became quite mat@@ ure .
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 8@@ 0s .
You were able to deliver docu@@ ments , were able to do it over networks .
We developed a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ text mark@@ up language .
And the system was capable of doing very , very large document@@ ation systems over computer networks .
So I took this system to a trade show in Ver@@ sa@@ il@@ les near Par@@ is in late No@@ v@@ ember 199@@ 0 .
And I was appro@@ ached by a nice young man called Ti@@ m Ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ Le@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; Are you I@@ an R@@ it@@ chi@@ e ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the World Wi@@ de Web .
And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pre@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
But he was completely convinced that his World Wi@@ de Web would take over the world one day .
And he tried to persu@@ ade me to write the bro@@ w@@ ser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graph@@ ics or fon@@ ts or lay@@ out or anything ; it was just pla@@ in text .
I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CE@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this .
So we didn &apos;t do it .
In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ text community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
In 199@@ 2 , his paper was re@@ j@@ ected for the Hy@@ per@@ text Con@@ fer@@ ence .
In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the conference in Se@@ attle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en was demonstr@@ ating his little bro@@ w@@ ser for the World Wi@@ de Web .
And I saw it , and I thought , y@@ ep , that &apos;s it .
And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the conference here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and I had no op@@ position in having Ti@@ m Ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ Le@@ e as the ke@@ y@@ note spe@@ aker .
So that puts me in pretty ill@@ us@@ tri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ick Ro@@ we who was at Dec@@ ca Re@@ cor@@ ds and turned down The Be@@ at@@ les .
There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went flying his plane when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an operating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill G@@ ates .
And the 12 publi@@ sh@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K. Ro@@ w@@ ling &apos;s H@@ arry P@@ ot@@ ter , I guess .
On the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en who wrote the world &apos;s first bro@@ w@@ ser for the World Wi@@ de Web .
And ac@@ cording to For@@ tun@@ e magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
In 199@@ 4 , I walked into a prison in Cam@@ bo@@ dia , and I met a 1@@ 2@@ -year-old boy who had been tor@@ tured and was den@@ i@@ ed access to coun@@ s@@ el .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political pri@@ son@@ ers , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
He was not a political pri@@ son@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -year-old boy who had st@@ ol@@ en a bic@@ y@@ cle .
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cam@@ bo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 13 developing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a law@@ yer and you have a right not to be tor@@ tured .
And what I recogni@@ zed was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool .
We often think of tor@@ ture as being political tor@@ ture or reser@@ ved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for political pri@@ son@@ ers .
It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ down legal systems , and unfortunately because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of investig@@ ation — it &apos;s che@@ aper than having a legal system , che@@ aper than having a law@@ yer and early access to coun@@ s@@ el — it is what happens most of the time .
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool in our lifetime , but it will requi@@ re three things .
First is the training , em@@ power@@ ment , and connection of defen@@ ders world@@ wide .
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is syst@@ em@@ atic early access to coun@@ s@@ el .
And the third is commit@@ ment .
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
Could we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I foun@@ ded Inter@@ national Bri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ usti@@ ce which has a specific mission of en@@ ding tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool and implement@@ ing due process rights in the 9@@ 3 countries by plac@@ ing trained law@@ y@@ ers at an early stage in police st@@ ations and in cour@@ tro@@ oms .
My first experiences , though , did come from Cam@@ bo@@ dia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cam@@ bo@@ dia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ mer R@@ ou@@ ge had killed them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 law@@ y@@ ers in the country , so consequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 1@@ 2@@ -year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband commit@@ ted a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
The first group of defen@@ ders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investig@@ ation ? &quot;
And there was sil@@ ence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ ended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investig@@ ation , because they all come with conf@@ es@@ sions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the conf@@ es@@ sions might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to encour@@ age the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
And it took a lot of cour@@ age for these defen@@ ders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implement@@ ing these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the jud@@ ges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a veget@@ able sel@@ ler , she was sitting outside of a house .
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks st@@ ole whatever the je@@ wel@@ ry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
She was pregn@@ ant at the time . She had ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ car@@ ried .
And when they brought her case to the jud@@ ge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your tor@@ ture conf@@ es@@ sion and you will be rele@@ ased . &quot; &quot; And the defen@@ ders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cam@@ bo@@ dia .
But Cam@@ bo@@ dia is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cam@@ bo@@ dia ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
In Bur@@ und@@ i I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -year-old boy , it was an 8@@ -year-old boy for ste@@ aling a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cu@@ te baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cu@@ te . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accu@@ sed of ste@@ aling two di@@ a@@ pers and an ir@@ on for her baby and still had been in prison .
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A jud@@ ge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thousand people here are without a law@@ yer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So law@@ y@@ ers began to cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ously stand up together to organiz@@ e a system where they can take cases .
But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the law@@ y@@ ers , but the connection of the law@@ y@@ ers that makes a difference .
For example , in Cam@@ bo@@ dia , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 law@@ y@@ ers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ c@@ ent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a law@@ yer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mu@@ m@@ bling
and gru@@ m@@ bling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an ex@@ cu@@ se for in@@ justice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he success@@ fully organized 6@@ 8 law@@ y@@ ers who have been syst@@ em@@ atically taking the cases .
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
I was recently in Egyp@@ t , and was inspired to meet with another group of law@@ y@@ ers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development ag@@ encies , and they were training pro@@ secu@@ tors and jud@@ ges , which is the normal bi@@ as , as op@@ posed to defen@@ ders .
And they showed me a man@@ ual which actually was an excel@@ l@@ ent man@@ ual .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gon@@ na copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ y@@ ers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
Pro@@ secu@@ tors were perfectly trained .
But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pro@@ secu@@ tor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a p@@ ause , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tured . &quot;
So the pieces are , not only the training of the law@@ y@@ ers , but us finding a way to syst@@ em@@ atically impl@@ ement early access to coun@@ s@@ el , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tured .
And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating mir@@ ac@@ les because of their commit@@ ment .
It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ c@@ ent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but defen@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
We have a program called J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ akers , and we realized there are people that are cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
So it &apos;s an online cont@@ est where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innov@@ ative way of implement@@ ing justice .
And there are 30 J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ akers throughout the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ ka to Sw@@ az@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through S@@ MS programs , through paral@@ eg@@ al programs , through whatever they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ akers , but people we cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be pun@@ ished .
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous law@@ y@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implement@@ ed ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on Dec@@ ember 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Y@@ outh Com@@ mun@@ ist Le@@ agu@@ e , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed pos@@ ters with the new laws , and went to the police st@@ ations and began what he says is a non-@@ violent legal revolution to protect citiz@@ en rights .
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defen@@ ders .
We need to syst@@ em@@ atically impl@@ ement early access to coun@@ s@@ el .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commit@@ ment to this .
And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wil@@ dly ide@@ al@@ istic .
N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end s@@ la@@ very , or end apar@@ the@@ id .
It began with a small group of people who decided they would comm@@ it .
Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite po@@ ems from the defen@@ ders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take cour@@ age friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the st@@ akes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defen@@ ders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool .
I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ ish@@ na , who actually was my inspir@@ ation for starting Inter@@ national Bri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ usti@@ ce .
V@@ ish@@ na was a 4@@ -year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ an prison in K@@ and@@ al Pro@@ vin@@ ce . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bar@@ s .
So , you know , there &apos;s bar@@ s . And by the time that V@@ ish@@ na was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my pin@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 15@@ 6 pri@@ son@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his fin@@ gers through .
Or if they were dark cells , it was like ir@@ on cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated , and he would put his fin@@ gers through .
And most of the pri@@ son@@ ers said that he was their greatest joy and their sun@@ sh@@ ine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ ish@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -year-old boy .
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material go@@ ods , but he had a sense of his own hero@@ ic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probab@@ ly I can &apos;t do everything .
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic imagination to imagine the shap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and invi@@ te you into this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Do@@ esn &apos;t say a word — just ro@@ lls away with it .
Do@@ esn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other cha@@ irs that are out there .
You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a st@@ ink .
You &apos;d follow that guy back to his cu@@ bic@@ le and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my chair ? &quot; &quot; Okay , so now it &apos;s Tu@@ es@@ day morning and you &apos;re at the office , and a meeting invit@@ ation po@@ ps up in your cal@@ en@@ dar .
And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office fur@@ n@@ it@@ ure .
It &apos;s an invol@@ un@@ tary refle@@ x — ding , click , bing — it &apos;s in your cal@@ en@@ dar , &quot; &quot; G@@ ot@@ ta go , I &apos;m already late for a meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Me@@ et@@ ings are important , right ?
And collabor@@ ation is key to the success of any enter@@ pri@@ se .
Let me tell you why .
There &apos;s the moder@@ ator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
It &apos;s kind of funny .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
H@@ i , it &apos;s Jo@@ e . I &apos;m working from home today .
( Laughter ) H@@ i , Jo@@ e . Thanks for jo@@ ining us today , great .
Our goal today is to come to an agre@@ ement on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .
No ? I thought I heard a be@@ ep . ( Laughter ) S@@ ound familiar ?
Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of views every month .
It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
Th@@ ou@@ sands of people wrote things like , &quot; O@@ M@@ G , that was my day today ! &quot;
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
But the truth is , we &apos;re not power@@ less at all .
In fact , the cure for M@@ A@@ S is right here in our hands .
It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
Or the maybe bu@@ tton , or whatever bu@@ tton is there for you not to accept immediately .
And you can make more thou@@ ght@@ ful decisions about accep@@ ting it .
People might actually start sending out ag@@ en@@ das . Imagine !
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
And even blind babies s@@ mile to the sound of the human voice .
&quot; Sh@@ are a childhood story . &quot;
&quot; En@@ d with an inspir@@ ing call to action . &quot;
No .
That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
In fact , if you over@@ use those devices , you &apos;re just going to come across as cli@@ ch@@ é@@ d or emo@@ tionally manipul@@ ative .
But there is one thing that all great TED Tal@@ ks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a r@@ ing@@ side seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED spe@@ akers , like these .
And it &apos;s this : Your number one task as a spe@@ aker is to trans@@ fer into your listen@@ ers &apos; minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
Let me show you what I mean .
Here &apos;s H@@ al@@ ey .
She is about to give a TED Talk and fran@@ kly , she &apos;s terri@@ fied .
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
Let &apos;s take a look inside H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
And incredibly , this exact pattern is being re@@ created in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navi@@ gate the world .
I@@ de@@ as come in all shapes and si@@ zes , from the complex and analy@@ tical to the simple and a@@ es@@ thetic .
Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
CA : Your mind is te@@ em@@ ing with ideas , and not just ran@@ dom@@ ly .
They &apos;re carefully lin@@ ked together .
Co@@ ll@@ ectively they form an amaz@@ ingly complex structure that is your personal world@@ view .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your world@@ view are crucial .
Now , different people &apos;s world@@ views can be dram@@ atically different .
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exper@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful force shap@@ ing human culture .
So pick one idea , and make it the through@@ -@@ line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say lin@@ ks back to it in some way .
Two , give your listen@@ ers a reason to care .
Be@@ fore you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their per@@ mission to wel@@ come you in .
And the main tool to achieve that ?
C@@ uri@@ osi@@ ty .
S@@ tir your audience &apos;s curiosi@@ ty .
If you can reve@@ al a dis@@ connection in someone &apos;s world@@ view , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
And once you &apos;ve s@@ par@@ ked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concep@@ ts that your audience already underst@@ ands .
You use the power of language to we@@ ave together concep@@ ts that already exist in your listen@@ ers &apos; minds — but not your language , their language .
The spe@@ akers often forget that many of the terms and concep@@ ts they live with are completely un@@ familiar to their audi@@ ences .
Now , metap@@ hor@@ s can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reve@@ al the desi@@ red shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listen@@ er already underst@@ ands .
C@@ RIS@@ PR allows you to cut and pas@@ te genetic information really easily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vivi@@ d explan@@ ation like that deli@@ vers a satis@@ fying a@@ ha moment as it sn@@ aps into place in our minds .
It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on tr@@ usted friends , and find out which parts they get conf@@ used by .
F@@ our , here &apos;s the final ti@@ p : M@@ ake your idea worth sharing .
By that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Who does this idea benefit ? &quot;
And I need you to be honest with the answer .
If the idea only ser@@ ves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
The audience will see right through you .
Can I ask you to please rec@@ all a time when you really loved something — a movie , an al@@ bu@@ m , a song or a book — and you recom@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ t@@ ed@@ ly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you anticip@@ ated that reaction , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person ha@@ ted it ?
So , by way of introduc@@ tion , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing pro@@ position .
So there &apos;s a useful ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pe about students that I see , a useful ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pe about you all .
I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ br@@ a-@@ two final ex@@ am , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categ@@ ories .
One is comput@@ ation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ gotten .
For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ati@@ c@@ s with leading co@@ effici@@ ents greater than one .
This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really strong gro@@ un@@ ding in reas@@ oning . M@@ ath reas@@ oning — we &apos;ll call it the applic@@ ation of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but en@@ sur@@ es they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
So first , five symp@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing math reas@@ oning wrong in your class@@ room .
One is a lack of initi@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You finish your lec@@ ture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-@@ explain the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
Stu@@ d@@ ents lack per@@ sever@@ ance .
They lack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re-@@ expla@@ ining concep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale .
There &apos;s an aver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ bes 99 percent of my students .
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mula to apply in that situation .
This is really destruc@@ tive .
David Mil@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ wood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good descrip@@ tion for this .
He s@@ wor@@ e off creating contempor@@ ary dr@@ ama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ respect , it shapes the neur@@ al path@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
He called it , &quot; &quot; an imp@@ ati@@ ence with ir@@ resolu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re imp@@ ati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t resol@@ ve quickly .
You expect si@@ t@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ zed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 22 minutes , three commercial brea@@ ks and a lau@@ gh track .
And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth sol@@ ving is that simple .
I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to reti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-@@ being when I teach this way .
I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our tex@@ t@@ books — particularly mas@@ s-@@ adop@@ ted tex@@ t@@ books — teach math reas@@ oning and patient problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s func@@ tionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics tex@@ t@@ book .
It appli@@ es equ@@ ally to math .
No@@ ti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a for@@ mula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compu@@ te .
I believe in real life .
And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was worth sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ plus of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suf@@ fici@@ ent information and had to go find some .
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth sol@@ ving is like that .
And the tex@@ t@@ book , I think , knows how it &apos;s ham@@ str@@ inging students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just sw@@ ap@@ ping out numbers and tw@@ e@@ aking the context a little bit .
And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the st@@ am@@ p this was mol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sam@@ ple problem you can return to to find the for@@ mula .
You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular un@@ it without knowing any physics , just knowing how to de@@ code a tex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a sha@@ me .
So I can diag@@ nose the problem a little more specifically in math .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
But what you have here is actually four separate lay@@ ers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate lay@@ ers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and present@@ ed to the student all at once , how that creates this imp@@ ati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
You also have the mathematical structure , talking about gri@@ ds , measu@@ re@@ ments , lab@@ els , points , ax@@ es , that sort of thing .
You have sub@@ steps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the ste@@ ep@@ est .
So I hope you can see .
I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ el@@ ling question , a comp@@ el@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re p@@ aving a smo@@ oth , straight path from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can step over the small cr@@ acks in the way .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem sol@@ ving .
So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can def@@ end two answers .
So you get people argu@@ ing against each other , friend versus friend , in p@@ airs , journ@@ aling , whatever .
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting anno@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lower le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the screen or the s@@ ki@@ er just above the mi@@ d line .
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D lab@@ els to talk about them more easily .
And then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ arro@@ w it down , specifically what that means .
And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
The math ser@@ ves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing .
But if you need to , your students can then develop those sub@@ steps together .
Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem sol@@ ving , that math reas@@ oning ?
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And I &apos;ll yi@@ el@@ d the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his du@@ es .
He talked about the for@@ mul@@ ation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t invol@@ ve them in the for@@ mul@@ ation of the problem .
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fairly comp@@ el@@ ling elements of problems like this from my tex@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ ports math reas@@ oning and patient problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
First things first , we elimin@@ ate all the sub@@ steps .
Stu@@ d@@ ents have to develop those , they have to for@@ mul@@ ate those .
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
N@@ one of it &apos;s a distr@@ actor , so we lose that .
Stu@@ d@@ ents need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
Does the color of the val@@ ve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ represent@@ ed question in math curr@@ ic@@ u@@ lum .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
And because this is the 21@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in tex@@ t@@ books , we go out and we take a picture of it .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fi@@ lling it up .
And it &apos;s fi@@ lling up slowly , ag@@ oniz@@ ingly slowly .
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
Stu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ches , ro@@ lling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?
And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the in@@ tro , I teach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I teach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?
And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the for@@ mula ; someone else knows how to work the for@@ mula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
But here , every student is on a level playing field of intui@@ tion .
Every@@ one &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathemati@@ cally and convers@@ ation@@ ally inti@@ mid@@ ated jo@@ ining the conversation .
We put names on the board , att@@ ach them to gu@@ esses , and kids have bought in here .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edi@@ tion .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terri@@ fying , because the the@@ ore@@ tical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edi@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scar@@ y to talk about sources of error when the the@@ ore@@ tical does not match up with the prac@@ tical .
But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-@@ install@@ ed with these viruses day one of the class .
These are the kids who now , one sem@@ est@@ er in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
We &apos;re no longer aver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defined what a word problem is .
We &apos;re no longer inti@@ mid@@ ated by math , because we &apos;re slowly re@@ defin@@ ing what math is .
This has been a lot of fun .
I encour@@ age math teachers I talk to to use multi@@ media , because it brings the real world into your class@@ room in high resolu@@ tion and full color ; to encour@@ age student intui@@ tion for that level playing field ; to ask the shor@@ test question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the tex@@ t@@ book is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your oblig@@ ation , for patient problem sol@@ ving and math reas@@ oning , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful .
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-@@ quality curr@@ ic@@ u@@ lum in our front po@@ cket .
It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open lic@@ enses has also never been che@@ aper or more u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous .
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 views in two weeks .
I get em@@ ails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visi@@ ted saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow .
I put this problem on my blog recently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y store , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 19 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems .
And the lin@@ ear model@@ ing involved in that was some good stuff for my class@@ room , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Mor@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?
And from all of this , I can only conclu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ gry for this .
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own intui@@ tion .
So I just really encour@@ age you , whatever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , par@@ ent , teacher , policy ma@@ ker , whatever — insi@@ st on better math curr@@ ic@@ u@@ lum .
We need more patient problem sol@@ vers . Thank you . ( Applause )
Inter@@ pre@@ ter : Pi@@ ano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my favorite musical sym@@ bol .
It means to play sof@@ tly .
Two p &apos;s — even sof@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s — extremely soft .
So it has a history of about 200 years .
I was born dea@@ f , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
And I believed it to be true .
Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
So how is it that I understand sound ?
Well , I watch how people be@@ have and respond to sound .
You people are like my l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ akers , and ampli@@ fy sound .
Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
&quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the pot@@ at@@ o-@@ chip ba@@ g ! &quot;
I &apos;m hy@@ per@@ -@@ vigil@@ ant around sound .
T@@ B@@ D , to be decided .
T@@ BC , to be continu@@ ed .
T@@ B@@ A , to be announ@@ ced .
In De@@ a@@ f culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
This is a sign for &quot; &quot; st@@ af@@ f &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
Pri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter .
At that time , sound was tr@@ en@@ ding , and this struc@@ k me ...
Now sound has come into my art territ@@ ory .
Is it going to further distance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I started creating a new body of work .
I ch@@ ose to be em@@ powered .
There &apos;s a massive culture around spo@@ ken language .
And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
And that way , I &apos;m able to main@@ tain relev@@ ancy in society today .
And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me to be heard .
And their voices hold value and curr@@ ency .
And I was surprised to see the simi@@ l@@ ari@@ ties between music and A@@ S@@ L .
And the same hol@@ ds true for a concept in A@@ S@@ L .
A@@ S@@ L is broken down into many different gr@@ am@@ ma@@ tical par@@ ame@@ ters .
The same appli@@ es to music in regar@@ ds to pit@@ ch , t@@ one and volume .
This is the sign T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
Star@@ ing at you .
U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
What are you looking at ?
A@@ w , stop .
For example , this is the sign for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun ri@@ ses and sets .
All ... day .
I feel the same hol@@ ds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , represent@@ ed in this drawing .
We have the st@@ af@@ f across the head and the ch@@ est .
Everybody , hands up .
Yes , got it .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; col@@ oniz@@ ation &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; col@@ oniz@@ ation &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclu@@ sive society .
And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
Den@@ ise K@@ ah@@ l@@ er-@@ Bra@@ aten : Hey , that &apos;s me .
( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produced by the Qu@@ ad@@ ro Cor@@ por@@ ation of West Vir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a R@@ adi@@ o S@@ hac@@ k an@@ ten@@ na att@@ ached to it .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
Sor@@ t of an interesting thing .
It &apos;s like , are science and plu@@ mb@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?
And if it looks a lot like a Bu@@ ick hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is .
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
In the case of G@@ ali@@ leo , he had two problems when he turned his tel@@ esco@@ pe to Satur@@ n .
And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
Here &apos;s the Vir@@ gin M@@ ary on the side of a glass window in Sa@@ o Pau@@ lo .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
Here &apos;s the Vir@@ gin M@@ ary on the back@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off .
I was born and raised in North Kore@@ a .
Al@@ though my family constantly stru@@ ggl@@ ed against poverty , I was always loved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ g@@ est of two in the family .
But then the great fam@@ ine began in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My sister and I would go search@@ ing for fi@@ re@@ wood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after mid@@ night .
I would w@@ ander the streets search@@ ing for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back eating chi@@ ps , and want@@ ing to ste@@ al them from him .
H@@ un@@ ger is hu@@ mili@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ness .
For a hun@@ gry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
On my nin@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
But even as a child , I could feel the heav@@ iness in their hear@@ ts .
Over a million North Kore@@ ans died of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
In the same year , my mother dis@@ appeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
Since we had never been separ@@ ated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left .
It was the biggest mist@@ ake I have ever made in my life .
But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
Sud@@ denly , I became an or@@ p@@ han and hom@@ eless .
My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
My goal was to find a du@@ st@@ y piece of bread in the tras@@ h .
But that is no way to survive .
I started to realize , be@@ g@@ ging would not be the solution .
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ legal markets .
Sometimes , I found small jobs in ex@@ change for food .
Once , I even spent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al mine , 33 meters under@@ ground without any prot@@ ection for up to 16 hours a day .
I was not un@@ common .
Many other or@@ ph@@ ans sur@@ vi@@ ved this way , or worse .
When I could not fall as@@ le@@ ep from bit@@ ter cold or hun@@ ger pa@@ ins , I ho@@ ped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
That hope kept me alive .
I don &apos;t mean big , gr@@ and hope .
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tras@@ h can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
H@@ op@@ e kept me alive .
Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
I knew the journey would be ri@@ sky , but I would be ris@@ king my life either way .
I could die of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in North Kore@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by escap@@ ing to China .
I had learned that many people tried to c@@ ross the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ ght@@ time to avoid being seen .
North Kore@@ an bor@@ der guar@@ ds often sho@@ ot and kill people trying to c@@ ross the bor@@ der without per@@ mission .
Chinese soldi@@ ers will catch and send back North Kore@@ ans , where they face se@@ v@@ ere pun@@ ish@@ ment .
I decided to c@@ ross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scar@@ ed of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to c@@ ross during the day , I thought I might be able to c@@ ross without being seen by anyone .
I made it to China on F@@ ebr@@ uary 15 , 2006 .
I was 16 years old .
I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
I thought more people would help me .
But it was harder than living in North Kore@@ a , because I was not free .
I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
By a mir@@ ac@@ le , some months later , I met someone who was running an under@@ ground shel@@ ter for North Kore@@ ans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular me@@ als for the first time in many years .
L@@ ater that year , an activi@@ st helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refuge@@ e .
I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social wor@@ ker told me that I had to go to high school .
Even in North Kore@@ a , I was an F student .
( Laughter ) And I bar@@ ely finished elem@@ ent@@ ary school .
And I remember I f@@ ought in school more than once a day .
T@@ ext@@ books and the libr@@ ary were not my play@@ ground .
My father tried very hard to motiv@@ ate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
At one point , my father gave up on me .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hur@@ t me deeply .
But ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , my level of motiv@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
So in America , it was kind of ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school .
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
But one day , I came home and my fo@@ ster mother had made chic@@ ken wings for dinner .
And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
When I looked down at my pl@@ ate , I saw the last chic@@ ken wing , that my fo@@ ster father had given me his .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words .
Sud@@ denly I remem@@ ber@@ ed my biological father .
My fo@@ ster father &apos;s small act of love remin@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hun@@ gry , even if he was star@@ ving .
I felt so suf@@ foc@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation .
My only wish that night was to co@@ ok a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacri@@ fic@@ e .
I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academ@@ ic a@@ ward for excel@@ l@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s list from the first sem@@ est@@ er in high school .
( Applause ) That chic@@ ken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ op@@ e is personal . H@@ op@@ e is something that no one can give to you .
You have to choose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
In North Kore@@ a , I made it myself .
H@@ op@@ e brought me to America .
But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming freedom .
My fo@@ ster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motiv@@ ated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
I did not come here by myself .
I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
Many people helped me along the way to get here .
North Kore@@ ans are fighting hard to survive .
They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
This is my message to you .
Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
Life can be hard for everyone , wher@@ ever you live .
My fo@@ ster father didn &apos;t inten@@ d to change my life .
In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the small@@ est act of love .
A piece of bread can satis@@ fy your hun@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
But I confid@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also save another Jo@@ sep@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other Jo@@ se@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survive .
Thank you .
( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : Jo@@ sep@@ h , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
Jo@@ sep@@ h Ki@@ m : In Kore@@ an ?
A@@ H : You can do English , then Kore@@ an as well .
( Laughter ) J@@ K : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Kore@@ an because I don &apos;t think I can make it without t@@ earing up .
N@@ una , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
I just wanted to say that I mis@@ s you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
And I — oh , go@@ sh .
I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
I will live my life happi@@ ly and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cr@@ y again .
( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
A@@ H : S@@ ure , please .
J@@ K : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pr@@ ay for me and think about me .
I just wanted to say thank you for le@@ tting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a dist@@ or@@ ted sequence of characters like this ?
How many of you found it really , really anno@@ ying ?
Okay , out@@ standing . So I invented that .
( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty fi@@ lling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to sub@@ mit the form millions and millions of times .
The reason it works is because humans , at least non-@@ visu@@ all@@ y-@@ imp@@ ai@@ red humans , have no trouble reading these dist@@ or@@ ted s@@ qui@@ gg@@ ly characters , wher@@ eas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
So for example , in the case of T@@ ick@@ et@@ master , the reason you have to type these dist@@ or@@ ted characters is to prevent scal@@ pers from writing a program that can buy millions of tic@@ k@@ ets , two at a time .
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As are used all over the Internet .
And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the preci@@ se sequence of random characters that is shown to the us@@ er is not so fortun@@ ate .
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o registr@@ ation page .
The random characters that happened to be shown to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word .
But the best part is the message that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
T@@ ext : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A Pro@@ ject is something that we did here at Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ el@@ ll@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company .
And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company .
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the following realiz@@ ation : It turns out that appro@@ xim@@ ately 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As are ty@@ ped everyday by people around the world .
When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
But then I started feeling bad .
See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
And if you multi@@ ply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is w@@ asting about 5@@ 00,000 hours every day ty@@ ping these anno@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As .
So then I started feeling bad .
( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As , because the security of the Web sort of depen@@ ds on them .
But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
So see , here &apos;s the thing .
Whi@@ le you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
Another way of putting it is , is there some hu@@ mon@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can sp@@ lit into tiny 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they solve a little bit of this problem ?
And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
So what you may not know is that now@@ ad@@ ays while you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
So let me explain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
Amazon , now with the K@@ ind@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
B@@ asi@@ cally the way this works is you start with an old book .
You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it .
Now scan@@ ning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
It gives you an image for every page of the book .
This is an image with text for every page of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical character recogni@@ tion , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not perfect .
Es@@ peci@@ ally for older books where the ink has f@@ aded and the pages have turned yellow , O@@ C@@ R cannot recognize a lot of the words .
For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
So the next time you type a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ ping are actually words that are coming from books that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed that the computer could not recognize .
And now the reason we have two words now@@ ad@@ ays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
And if you type the correc@@ t word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assu@@ mes you are human , and it also gets some confid@@ ence that you ty@@ ped the other word correc@@ tly .
And if we repe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed accur@@ ately .
So this is how the system works .
And basically , since we rele@@ ased it about three or four years ago , a lot of web@@ sites have started swit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people w@@ ast@@ ed their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are helping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
So for example , T@@ ick@@ et@@ master .
So every time you buy tic@@ k@@ ets on T@@ ick@@ et@@ master , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
Facebook : Every time you add a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
Twitter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other sites are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
And in fact , the number of sites that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing per day is really , really large .
It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As on the Internet .
( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two ran@@ dom@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en English words next to each other .
So funny things can happen .
For example , we present@@ ed this word .
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christi@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
But if you present it along with another ran@@ dom@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en word , bad things can happen .
So we get this . ( T@@ ext : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of God .
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
John@@ Ed@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .com ( T@@ ext : D@@ am@@ n liber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insul@@ ting people left and right everyday .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insul@@ ting people .
See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re present@@ ing two ran@@ dom@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en words , interesting things can happen .
So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet mem@@ e that tens of thousands of people have particip@@ ated in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art .
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what p@@ ecu@@ liar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ext : invisible to@@ aster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
Then of course , you fill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cu@@ te . ( T@@ ext : cl@@ en@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
( T@@ ext : st@@ oned foun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logical sh@@ vis@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ op D@@ og@@ g . ( Laughter )
Okay , so this is my favorite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
This is the number of dist@@ inct people that have helped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge .
And it is numbers like these that motiv@@ ate my research agenda .
So the question that motiv@@ ates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale achiev@@ ements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done histor@@ ically — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ rami@@ ds of Egyp@@ t or the P@@ an@@ ama Can@@ al or putting a man on the Mo@@ on — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordin@@ ating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge .
So the question that motiv@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the Mo@@ on with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been sem@@ i@@ -@@ qui@@ et@@ ly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !
( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my graduate student , Se@@ ver@@ in Hac@@ ker .
Okay , that &apos;s Se@@ ver@@ in Hac@@ ker .
So I posed the question to my graduate student .
By the way , you did hear me correc@@ tly ; his last name is Hac@@ ker .
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people transl@@ ating the Web into every major language for free ?
Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
First of all , transl@@ ating the Web .
So right now the Web is parti@@ tion@@ ed into multiple languages .
A large fr@@ action of it is in English .
If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
But there &apos;s large frac@@ tions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
So I would like to trans@@ late all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to trans@@ late ?
Why can &apos;t we use machine transl@@ ation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine transl@@ ation now@@ ad@@ ays is starting to trans@@ late some s@@ enten@@ ces here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ late the whole Web ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mist@@ akes .
Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mist@@ ake , since it makes so many mist@@ akes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
So let me show you an example of something that was transl@@ ated with a machine .
Actually it was a for@@ um pos@@ t .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ crip@@ t .
It was transl@@ ated from Jap@@ an@@ ese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person starts apo@@ logi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s transl@@ ated with a computer .
So the next sentence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expla@@ ining something .
Rem@@ ember , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ crip@@ t .
( T@@ ext : At often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time inst@@ all a error is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
( T@@ ext : How many times like the wind , a po@@ le , and the drag@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
( T@@ ext : This insul@@ t to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
( T@@ ext : Please apo@@ logi@@ ze for your stupi@@ di@@ ty . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer transl@@ ation , not yet good enough .
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ late the whole Web .
So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
We could pay professional language trans@@ lat@@ ors to trans@@ late the whole Web .
We could do that .
Un@@ fortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
For example , transl@@ ating a tiny , tiny fr@@ action of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , S@@ pan@@ ish .
Wikipedia exists in S@@ pan@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
If we wanted to trans@@ late the other 80 percent into S@@ pan@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most explo@@ ited , out@@ sour@@ c@@ ing country out there .
So it would be very expensive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people transl@@ ating the Web into every major language for free .
Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hur@@ d@@ les , two big obst@@ ac@@ les .
The first one is a lack of bi@@ lin@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bi@@ lin@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ late .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motiv@@ ation .
How are we going to motiv@@ ate people to actually trans@@ late the Web for free ?
Nor@@ m@@ ally , you have to pay people to do this .
So how are we going to motiv@@ ate them to do it for free ?
Now when we were starting to think about this , we were bloc@@ ked by these two things .
But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
And that is to transform language transl@@ ation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bi@@ lin@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education .
So it turns out that today , there are over 1.@@ 2 billion people learning a foreign language .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
So people really , really want to learn a new language .
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simul@@ tane@@ ously transl@@ ating the Web .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
So the way this works is wh@@ enever you &apos;re a just a begin@@ ner , we give you very , very simple s@@ enten@@ ces .
There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple s@@ enten@@ ces on the Web .
We give you very , very simple s@@ enten@@ ces along with what each word means .
And as you trans@@ late them , and as you see how other people trans@@ late them , you start learning the language .
And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex s@@ enten@@ ces to trans@@ late .
But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
People really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
So people really do learn a language .
And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
Because you see with Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real content .
As op@@ posed to learning with mad@@ e-@@ up s@@ enten@@ ces , people are learning with real content , which is inher@@ ently interesting .
So people really do learn a language .
But perhaps more surpri@@ sing@@ ly , the transl@@ ations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ ners , the transl@@ ations that we get are as accur@@ ate as those of professional language trans@@ lat@@ ors , which is very surprising .
So let me show you one example .
This is a sentence that was transl@@ ated from Ger@@ man into English .
The top is the Ger@@ man .
The middle is an English transl@@ ation that was done by somebody who was a professional English transl@@ ator who we paid 20 c@@ ents a word for this transl@@ ation .
And the bottom is a transl@@ ation by users of Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , none of whom knew any Ger@@ man before they started using the site .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
Now of course , we play a tr@@ ick here to make the transl@@ ations as good as professional language trans@@ lat@@ ors .
We comb@@ ine the transl@@ ations of multiple begin@@ ners to get the quality of a single professional transl@@ ator .
Now even though we &apos;re comb@@ ining the transl@@ ations , the site actually can trans@@ late pretty fast .
So let me show you , this is our esti@@ mates of how fast we could trans@@ late Wikipedia from English into S@@ pan@@ ish .
Rem@@ ember , this is 50 million doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ worth of value .
So if we wanted to trans@@ late Wikipedia into S@@ pan@@ ish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hope@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ late extremely fast with this project .
Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this provi@@ des a fair business model for language education .
So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student p@@ ays , and in particular , the student p@@ ays Ro@@ se@@ t@@ ta St@@ one 500 dollars .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extremely un@@ fair towards the poor .
This is totally bi@@ ased towards the rich .
Now see , in Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re transl@@ ating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for transl@@ ations .
So this is how we could mon@@ eti@@ ze this .
Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
But the mag@@ ical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language .
So the nice thing about Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it provi@@ des a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t dis@@ crimin@@ ate against poor people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private be@@ ta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
We haven &apos;t yet launched this Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
So thank you .

In Oxford in the 195@@ 0s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very un@@ usual , named Ali@@ ce Ste@@ war@@ t .
And Ali@@ ce was un@@ usual par@@ tly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 195@@ 0s .
And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ g@@ est F@@ el@@ low to be el@@ ected to the Ro@@ y@@ al Col@@ le@@ ge of P@@ hy@@ sici@@ ans .
She was un@@ usual too because she continu@@ ed to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ vor@@ ced and was a single par@@ ent , she continu@@ ed her medical work .
And she was un@@ usual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidem@@ i@@ ology , the study of patterns in disease .
But like every scientist , she appreci@@ ated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
The hard problem that Ali@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ri@@ sing incid@@ ence of childhood can@@ c@@ ers .
Most disease is cor@@ related with poverty , but in the case of childhood can@@ c@@ ers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from af@@ flu@@ ent families .
So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this an@@ om@@ al@@ y ?
Now , Ali@@ ce had trouble getting fun@@ ding for her research .
In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the L@@ ady T@@ ata M@@ em@@ ori@@ al pri@@ ze .
And that meant she knew she only had one shot at coll@@ ecting her data .
Now , she had no idea what to look for .
This really was a need@@ le in a ha@@ yst@@ ack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
H@@ ad the children e@@ aten bo@@ iled swe@@ ets ?
H@@ ad they consu@@ med colo@@ red dr@@ in@@ ks ?
Did they eat fish and chi@@ ps ?
Did they have in@@ door or out@@ door plu@@ mb@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
And when her carbon copi@@ ed questi@@ on@@ n@@ aire started to come back , one thing and one thing only ju@@ mp@@ ed out with the statistic@@ al clar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X@@ -@@ ra@@ yed when pregn@@ ant .
Now that finding fle@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal wisdom .
Con@@ venti@@ onal wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a th@@ res@@ hold .
It fle@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal wisdom , which was huge en@@ th@@ usias@@ m for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ ray machine .
And it fle@@ w in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them .
Ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , Ali@@ ce Ste@@ war@@ t r@@ ush@@ ed to publi@@ sh her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ dings in The L@@ anc@@ et in 195@@ 6 .
People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Pri@@ ze , and Ali@@ ce really was in a big hur@@ ry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they dis@@ appeared .
In fact , she need not have hur@@ ried .
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establi@@ sh@@ ments aband@@ oned the practice of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pregn@@ ant women .
The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely available , but nobody wanted to know .
A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
O@@ pen@@ ness alone can &apos;t drive change .
So for 25 years Ali@@ ce Ste@@ war@@ t had a very big fight on her hands .
So , how did she know that she was right ?
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
She worked with a stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an named George K@@ ne@@ ale , and George was pretty much everything that Ali@@ ce wasn &apos;t .
So , Ali@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and George was a rec@@ lu@@ se .
Ali@@ ce was very warm , very empa@@ thetic with her patients .
George fran@@ kly prefer@@ red numbers to people .
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Ste@@ war@@ t wrong . &quot; &quot; He activ@@ ely s@@ ought dis@@ confir@@ ma@@ tion .
Di@@ f@@ fer@@ ent ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ prove her .
He saw his job as creating conflict around her the@@ ories .
Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Ali@@ ce the confid@@ ence she needed to know that she was right .
It &apos;s a fantastic model of collabor@@ ation — thinking part@@ ners who aren &apos;t echo cha@@ mb@@ ers .
I wonder how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such collabor@@ ators .
Ali@@ ce and George were very good at conflict .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of construc@@ tive conflict requi@@ re ?
Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
That means we have to res@@ ist the neuro@@ biological drive , which means that we really pre@@ fer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to see@@ k out people with different back@@ gro@@ unds , different discipl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
That requires a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
Because you simply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
Ali@@ ce &apos;s daughter told me that every time Ali@@ ce went head@@ -@@ to-@@ head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-@@ to-@@ one relationship .
But it stri@@ kes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest dis@@ ast@@ ers that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of aff@@ ecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
So how do organizations think ?
Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
In surve@@ ys of European and American execu@@ tives , fully 85 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issues or concer@@ ns at work that they were afraid to raise .
Af@@ raid of the conflict that that would provo@@ ke , afraid to get em@@ bro@@ iled in argu@@ ments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bo@@ und to lose .
E@@ igh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Ali@@ ce so tri@@ um@@ ph@@ antly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
Because it does take sk@@ ill and practice , too .
If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
So , recently , I worked with an execu@@ tive named Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medical device company .
And Jo@@ e was very worried about the device that he was working on .
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created mar@@ gin@@ s of error that could really hur@@ t people .
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
But he kept wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
In the end , Jo@@ e and I found a way for him to raise his concer@@ ns .
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doub@@ ts .
So now Jo@@ e had al@@ lies . They could think together .
And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
Jo@@ e was what a lot of people might think of as a wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wer , except that like almost all wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lowers , he wasn &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was passion@@ ately dev@@ ot@@ ed to the organization and the higher pur@@ pos@@ es that that organization ser@@ ved .
But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the sil@@ ence .
And when he dar@@ ed to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagin@@ ed .
And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
They think of him as a leader .
So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
Well , the University of Del@@ ft requires that its Ph@@ D students have to sub@@ mit five stat@@ ements that they &apos;re prepared to def@@ end .
It doesn &apos;t really matter what the stat@@ ements are about , what matters is that the candi@@ dat@@ es are willing and able to stand up to auth@@ ority .
I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to Ph@@ D candi@@ dat@@ es is far too few people , and way too late in life .
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
The fact is that most of the biggest cat@@ astr@@ op@@ h@@ es that we &apos;ve wit@@ n@@ essed rar@@ ely come from information that is secret or hidden .
It comes from information that is fre@@ ely available and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully blind to , because we can &apos;t hand@@ le , don &apos;t want to hand@@ le , the conflict that it provo@@ kes .
But when we d@@ are to break that sil@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create conflict , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
O@@ p@@ en information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the hab@@ it and the tal@@ ent and the moral cour@@ age to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

Thank you .
Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Ar@@ us@@ ha , T@@ anz@@ ania .
I spoke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my pr@@ ou@@ dest cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
Be@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in Mal@@ aw@@ i .
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
My English lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it .
( Laughter ) I had never been surro@@ unded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
All sist@@ ers , excep@@ ting me .
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
Be@@ fore I discovered the wonder@@ s of science , I was just a simple farm@@ er in a country of poor farmers .
Like everyone else , we grew ma@@ ize .
One year our fortun@@ e turned very bad .
In 2001 we experienced an awful fam@@ ine .
Wi@@ thin five months all Mal@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night .
On@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
In Mal@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ dar@@ y school , you have to pay school fe@@ es .
Because of the hun@@ ger , I was forced to drop out of school .
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so I was determin@@ ed to do anything possible to recei@@ ve education .
So I went to a libr@@ ary .
I read books , science books , especially physics .
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diagr@@ ams and pictures to learn the words around them .
Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a w@@ ind@@ mi@@ ll could pu@@ mp water and generate electricity .
Pu@@ mp water meant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a def@@ ense against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ encing by that time .
So I decided I would build one w@@ ind@@ mi@@ ll for myself .
But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materials .
Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
( Laughter ) I found a tr@@ actor f@@ an , sho@@ ck absor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ pes .
U@@ sing a bic@@ y@@ cle frame and an old bic@@ y@@ cle dy@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine .
It was one light at first .
And then four lights , with swit@@ ches , and even a circu@@ it bre@@ aker , model@@ ed after an electric b@@ ell .
Another machine pu@@ m@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Qu@@ eu@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which lead to b@@ log@@ gers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
I had never seen an airplane before .
I had never sle@@ p@@ t in a hotel .
So , on stage that day in Ar@@ us@@ ha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afric@@ ans , and the poor who are stru@@ ggl@@ ing with your dreams .
God bl@@ ess .
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
W@@ hat@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up .
Thank you .

In the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist E@@ aster@@ n Germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
You had to regi@@ ster a sam@@ ple she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restric@@ t freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any major las@@ er prin@@ ter manu@@ f@@ actu@@ rer and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the att@@ acks based on the att@@ ac@@ kers .
We have three main groups .
We have online crimin@@ als .
Like here , we have Mr. Di@@ mi@@ try G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
And the motiv@@ es of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online att@@ acks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their att@@ acks .
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mir T@@ s@@ ast@@ sin form T@@ ar@@ tu in Est@@ onia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
This is Ste@@ ph@@ en Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ di@@ n .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w Anderson , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the il@@ legal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sho@@ pping from an inf@@ ected computer .
The U.S. Sec@@ re@@ t Ser@@ v@@ ice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ wis@@ s bank account of Mr. S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victi@@ m of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of att@@ ac@@ kers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
They &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else — motiv@@ ated by prot@@ ests , motiv@@ ated by an opini@@ on , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
Gr@@ ou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ ym@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major play@@ er in the field of online att@@ acks .
So those are the three main att@@ ac@@ kers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , hac@@ k@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ on@@ ym@@ ous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the att@@ acks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ ority from The Ne@@ ther@@ lands — or actually , it was .
It was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were hac@@ ked into .
Some@@ body broke in and they hac@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with Du@@ t@@ ch government represent@@ atives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ sible that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar hac@@ k .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a hac@@ k like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A.
They sell certi@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with certi@@ fic@@ ates ?
Well you need a certi@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like G@@ ma@@ il .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like Iran , where dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents use foreign services like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .
Ex@@ cep@@ t they can if they hac@@ k into a foreign C@@ .@@ A.
and issue ro@@ gue certi@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in Egyp@@ t ?
Well in Egyp@@ t , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the Egyp@@ ti@@ an secret police in A@@ pri@@ l 2011 , and when they were lo@@ oting the building they found lots of papers .
A@@ mon@@ g those papers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 E@@ ur@@ os to the Egyp@@ ti@@ an government .
The company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
So Western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called S@@ tate T@@ ro@@ jan was found , which was a tro@@ jan used by Ger@@ man government of@@ fici@@ als to investig@@ ate their own citizens .
If you are a sus@@ p@@ ect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tap@@ ped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will ta@@ p your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like S@@ tate T@@ ro@@ jan to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ jan , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pass@@ words .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citiz@@ en .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Pri@@ vac@@ y is impli@@ ed .
Pri@@ vac@@ y is not up for discus@@ sion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we bl@@ ind@@ ly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about enjo@@ ying mun@@ dan@@ e sounds .
This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ yer .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally understood that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science of@@ fici@@ ally has no opini@@ on .
It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
And , consequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illu@@ sion — that the separ@@ ation between science and human values is an illu@@ sion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for mor@@ ality and human values , because science de@@ als with facts , and facts and values seem to bel@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es .
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descrip@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite clearly un@@ true .
V@@ alu@@ es are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-@@ being of conscious creatures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have eth@@ ical oblig@@ ations toward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for ro@@ cks ?
It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can suf@@ fer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow pri@@ mates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a f@@ actual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ constru@@ ed the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human mor@@ ality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point redu@@ ci@@ ble to a concer@@ n about conscious experience and its possible changes .
Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ultimately rel@@ ate to conditions after death — either to an e@@ tern@@ ity of happiness with God or an e@@ tern@@ ity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after death is itself a f@@ actual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
Now , to speak about the conditions of well-@@ being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continu@@ um of such facts .
We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where str@@ angers cannot find the basis for pe@@ ace@@ ful collabor@@ ation , where people are mur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ately .
And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continu@@ um towards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ lli@@ c , to a place where a conference like this is even conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able .
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
Would ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
Probab@@ ly not .
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately bl@@ ame their neighb@@ ors ? Probab@@ ly not .
There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human communities fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths .
And mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arr@@ ang@@ ements .
But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-@@ being we are , of neces@@ si@@ ty , talking about the human brain .
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
Even if the suici@@ de bomb@@ er does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ gin@@ s in the after@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ fortun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the product of his brain .
So the contribu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
And so therefore whatever cultural vari@@ ation there is in how human beings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neuro@@ science , psycho@@ logy , etc .
So , what I &apos;m argu@@ ing is that value &apos;s reduc@@ ed to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
And we can therefore visu@@ alize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with pe@@ aks and val@@ le@@ ys that correspon@@ d to differences in the well-@@ being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-@@ being that we rar@@ ely access , that few people access .
And these aw@@ a@@ it our discovery .
Per@@ haps some of these states can be appropri@@ ately called my@@ stic@@ al or spir@@ itual .
Per@@ haps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are struc@@ tured but other minds possibly could access them .
Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guar@@ ante@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able moral question .
I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bo@@ mb Iran &apos;s nuclear facili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business expen@@ se .
( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-@@ being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
And just ad@@ mit@@ ting this — just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expect@@ ations of human cooper@@ ation in the future .
For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corpor@@ al pun@@ ish@@ ment in the class@@ room is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wo@@ o@@ den board , hard , and rais@@ ing large bru@@ is@@ es and bli@@ sters and even bre@@ aking the skin .
And hundreds of thousands of children , incid@@ ent@@ ally , are subj@@ ected to this every year .
The loc@@ ations of these en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed distr@@ ic@@ ts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut .
And the r@@ ation@@ ale for this behavior is expli@@ ci@@ tly religious .
The cre@@ ator of the universe himself has told us not to s@@ par@@ e the ro@@ d , l@@ est we spo@@ il the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ bs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , gener@@ ally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public hu@@ mili@@ ation as a way of encour@@ aging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
( Laughter ) Is there any doub@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-@@ being is truly un@@ defined , and seem@@ ingly perpe@@ tually open to be re-@@ constru@@ ed .
And so , how therefore can there be an obj@@ ective notion of well-@@ being ?
Well , consider by analog@@ y , the concept of physical health .
The concept of physical health is un@@ defined .
As we just heard from Michael S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years .
When this stat@@ ue was car@@ ved the average life expect@@ ancy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ d@@ dle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ ath@@ on at age 200 will be considered a profound dis@@ ability .
People will send you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that condition .
( Laughter ) No@@ ti@@ ce that the fact that the concept of health is open , genu@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it v@@ acu@@ ous .
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequ@@ ential as any we make in science .
Another thing to notice is there may be many pe@@ aks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thri@@ ve ; there may be equivalent ways to organiz@@ e a human society so as to maxi@@ mi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ mine an obj@@ ective mor@@ ality ?
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be t@@ emp@@ ted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
There is clearly a range of materials that constitu@@ te healthy food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless a clear dist@@ inc@@ tion between food and po@@ ison .
The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not t@@ emp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nutri@@ tion .
Many people worry that a universal mor@@ ality would requi@@ re moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mit of no excep@@ tions .
So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an excep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
Why would we think this ?
Con@@ si@@ der , by analog@@ y , the game of ch@@ ess .
Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Qu@@ een , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
But it clearly ad@@ m@@ its some excep@@ tions .
There are moments when losing your Qu@@ een is a brilliant thing to do .
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
And yet , ch@@ ess is a do@@ main of perfect obj@@ ectiv@@ ity .
The fact that there are excep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sphere .
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally speaking , of our intellec@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Pal@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the proud den@@ iz@@ ens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and dau@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ oth b@@ ags ?
And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with leng@@ ths of steel cable , or throw bat@@ tery aci@@ d in their faces if they dec@@ line the privile@@ ge of being smo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?
Well , who are we not to say this ?
Who are we to pre@@ tend that we know so little about human well-@@ being that we have to be non-@@ jud@@ g@@ mental about a practice like this ?
I &apos;m not talking about volun@@ tary wearing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
But what does volun@@ tary mean in a community where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first impul@@ se , rather often , is to mur@@ der her out of sha@@ me ?
Just let that fact det@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is kill her .
What are the chan@@ ces that repres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a new@@ s@@ stand almost anywhere in the civiliz@@ ed world .
Now , gr@@ ant@@ ed , for many men it may requi@@ re a degree in philosoph@@ y to see something wrong with these images .
( Laughter ) But if we are in a refl@@ ective mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expres@@ sion of psycho@@ logical balance with respect to vari@@ ables like y@@ outh and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the opti@@ mal environment in which to raise our children ?
Probab@@ ly not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extre@@ mes that repres@@ ents a place of better balance .
( Applause ) Per@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ aks on the moral landscape .
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
Now the ir@@ ony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious dem@@ a@@ go@@ gues of one form or another .
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-@@ being .
In fact , the en@@ dur@@ ance of religion as a len@@ s through which most people view moral questions has separ@@ ated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genoci@@ de or nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or poverty or any other hu@@ g@@ ely consequ@@ ential issue .
But the dem@@ a@@ go@@ gues are right about one thing : We need a universal concep@@ tion of human values .
Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?
Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — especially sec@@ ular , academ@@ ic , scientist types .
When talking about mor@@ ality we value differences of opini@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
So , for instance the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama gets up every morning medi@@ t@@ ating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integr@@ al compon@@ ent of human happiness .
On the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very fon@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and tor@@ tur@@ ing and killing young women .
So , we appear to have a genu@@ ine difference of opini@@ on about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) Most Western intellec@@ tu@@ als look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real argument that potenti@@ ally fall@@ s within the pur@@ view of science .
He li@@ kes chocolate , he li@@ kes van@@ illa .
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persu@@ ade the other . &quot; &quot; No@@ ti@@ ce that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Ed@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ or@@ ist .
If you ask the smar@@ test physici@@ sts around who is the smar@@ test physici@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten .
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ gu@@ s .
It doesn &apos;t reson@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physici@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing theory .
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of str@@ ing theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any str@@ ing theory clu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ enever we are talking about facts certain opini@@ ons must be exclu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a do@@ main of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral exper@@ ti@@ se , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral geni@@ us even ? How have we convinced ourselves
that every opini@@ on has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these subj@@ ects worth consider@@ ing ?
Does the T@@ ali@@ ban have a point of view on physics that is worth consider@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ignor@@ ance any less obvious on the subject of human well-@@ being ?
( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ mit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to that do@@ main of facts .
It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ efs and des@@ ir@@ es that reli@@ ably lead to need@@ less human suffering .
Just ad@@ mit@@ ting this will transform our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
We live in a world in which the bo@@ und@@ aries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
We live in a world filled with destruc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ invented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
It seems to me , therefore , pat@@ ently obvious that we can no more respect and toler@@ ate vast differences in no@@ tions of human well-@@ being than we can respect or toler@@ ate vast differences in the no@@ tions about how disease spre@@ ads , or in the safety stand@@ ards of buildings and air@@ planes .
We simply must conver@@ ge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
And to do that , we have to ad@@ mit that these questions have answers .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
W@@ he@@ ther in this audience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ r@@ age thing , after as well , some of them .
L@@ angu@@ age seems to be really important here .
When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dres@@ sed in cl@@ oth b@@ ags .
I &apos;ve lived in the Musli@@ m world , spo@@ ken with a lot of Musli@@ m women .
And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebr@@ ation of female speci@@ al@@ ness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is argu@@ ably a sophistic@@ ated psycho@@ logical view — &quot; that male l@@ ust is not to be tr@@ usted . &quot;
I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seem@@ ing kind of cultural im@@ peri@@ alist ?
S@@ am H@@ arr@@ is : Yeah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sentence , watching the clock tic@@ king , but the question is : What is volun@@ tary in a context where men have certain expect@@ ations , and you &apos;re guar@@ ante@@ ed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?
And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a ve@@ il , or a very funny hat , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be free to volunt@@ arily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the con@@ str@@ ain@@ ts that these women are placed under .
And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full bur@@ q@@ a .
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
But can you re@@ conci@@ le that ?
I think I understood you to say that you could re@@ conci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
P@@ ain@@ t your picture of what ro@@ lling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ ancing moral progress with r@@ ich@@ ness .
S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ mit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to ad@@ mit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qu@@ alities of ourselves in much greater detail .
So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emo@@ tion like empa@@ thy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that encour@@ age it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we begin to sh@@ ine light on that we are inevit@@ ably going to conver@@ ge on that fact space .
So , everything is not going to be up for grab@@ s .
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ iling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confid@@ ent and well-@@ educ@@ ated in the context of men who do desire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that compu@@ l@@ s@@ ory ve@@ iling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the brains of everyone involved and actually inter@@ ro@@ gate them .
Do people love their dau@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your inst@@ inc@@ tive current jud@@ g@@ ment on some of these issues ?
S@@ H : Well yeah , mo@@ du@@ lo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly del@@ u@@ sional belief system .
So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most com@@ passionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts ali@@ g@@ ned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emo@@ tion of love .
But again , then we have to talk about well-@@ being in a larger context .
It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then blo@@ wing himself up on a bus .
CA : S@@ am , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an honor . Thank you .

( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a dist@@ inct privile@@ ge to be here .
A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Con@@ gr@@ ess@@ woman G@@ abri@@ el@@ le Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds at the early st@@ ages of her reco@@ very from one of those awful bu@@ lle@@ ts .
This one enter@@ ed her left h@@ emis@@ p@@ here , and kno@@ c@@ ked out her Bro@@ ca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
And in this ses@@ sion , G@@ ab@@ by &apos;s working with a speech ther@@ api@@ st , and she &apos;s stru@@ ggl@@ ing to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devast@@ ated , until she ultimately brea@@ ks down into so@@ b@@ bing t@@ ears , and she starts so@@ b@@ bing wor@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly into the arms of her ther@@ api@@ st .
And after a few moments , her ther@@ api@@ st tries a new t@@ ack , and they start singing together , and G@@ ab@@ by starts to sing through her t@@ ears , and you can hear her clearly able to en@@ unci@@ ate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she s@@ ings , in one descen@@ ding scale , she s@@ ings , &quot; Let it sh@@ ine , let it sh@@ ine , let it sh@@ ine . &quot;
And it &apos;s a very powerful and po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant remin@@ der of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
Se@@ e@@ ing this video of G@@ ab@@ by Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds remin@@ ded me of the work of Dr. G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed Sch@@ lau@@ g , one of the pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent neuro@@ scientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Sch@@ lau@@ g is a pro@@ pon@@ ent of a therapy called M@@ el@@ odi@@ c In@@ ton@@ ation Th@@ er@@ apy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
Sch@@ lau@@ g found that his str@@ o@@ ke victims who were ap@@ ha@@ sic , could not form s@@ enten@@ ces of thre@@ e@@ - or four@@ -@@ word s@@ enten@@ ces , but they could still sing the ly@@ r@@ ics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; H@@ ap@@ py B@@ ir@@ th@@ day To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the E@@ ag@@ les or the Ro@@ lling St@@ ones .
And after 70 hours of inten@@ sive singing les@@ sons , he found that the music was able to literally re@@ wi@@ re the brains of his patients and create a homo@@ log@@ ous speech center in their right h@@ emis@@ p@@ here to com@@ pens@@ ate for the left h@@ emis@@ p@@ here &apos;s damage .
When I was 17 , I visi@@ ted Dr. Sch@@ lau@@ g &apos;s lab , and in one after@@ no@@ on he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how mu@@ sici@@ ans had fundament@@ ally different brain structure than non-@@ mu@@ sici@@ ans , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our pre@@ fron@@ tal cortex all the way back to our cer@@ e@@ bel@@ lum , how music was becoming a neuro@@ psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tric mod@@ ality to help children with autism , to help people stru@@ ggl@@ ing with stress and an@@ xi@@ ety and depression , how deeply Par@@ kin@@ son@@ i@@ an patients would find that their tre@@ mor and their ga@@ it would ste@@ ady when they listen@@ ed to music ,
and how lat@@ e-@@ stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dem@@ enti@@ a was so far progr@@ essed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tun@@ e by C@@ ho@@ p@@ in at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
But I had an ul@@ terior mo@@ tive of visi@@ ting G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed Sch@@ lau@@ g , and it was this : that I was at a cros@@ s@@ roads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
I had just complet@@ ed my under@@ graduate , and I was working as a research as@@ sist@@ ant at the lab of Den@@ n@@ is S@@ el@@ k@@ o@@ e , studying Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fall@@ en in love with neuro@@ science . I wanted to become a sur@@ geon .
I wanted to become a doctor like Paul F@@ arm@@ er or R@@ ick Ho@@ des , these kind of f@@ ear@@ less men who go into places like Hait@@ i or E@@ thi@@ opi@@ a and work with AIDS patients with multi@@ dru@@ g@@ -@@ resist@@ ant tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , or with children with dis@@ figur@@ ing can@@ c@@ ers .
I wanted to become that kind of R@@ ed C@@ ross doctor , that doctor without bor@@ ders .
On the other hand , I had played the vi@@ o@@ lin my entire life .
Music for me was more than a passion . It was obs@@ es@@ sion .
It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Ju@@ illi@@ ard School in Manhattan , and to have played my de@@ but with Z@@ u@@ b@@ in Me@@ h@@ ta and the Isra@@ el@@ i phi@@ l@@ har@@ mon@@ ic or@@ ch@@ estra in T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v , and it turned out that G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed Sch@@ lau@@ g had studied as an organ@@ ist at the Vi@@ en@@ na Con@@ serv@@ atory , but had given up his love for music to pur@@ su@@ e a career in medicine . And that after@@ no@@ on , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
And he said that there were still times when he w@@ ished he could go back and play the or@@ gan the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the vi@@ o@@ lin simply would not .
And after two more years of studying music , I decided to sho@@ ot for the impossible before taking the M@@ C@@ A@@ T and ap@@ pl@@ ying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. G@@ up@@ ta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to sho@@ ot for the impossible and I took an audi@@ tion for the est@@ e@@ em@@ ed Los Angeles Phi@@ l@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
It was my first audi@@ tion , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offer@@ ed the position .
And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to per@@ form in an or@@ ch@@ estra , to per@@ form in the i@@ con@@ ic Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all in an or@@ ch@@ estra conduc@@ ted now by the famous G@@ ust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el , but much more importantly to me to be surro@@ unded by mu@@ sici@@ ans and ment@@ ors that became my new family , my new musical home .
But a year later , I met another mu@@ sici@@ an who had also studied at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , one who prof@@ oun@@ dly helped me find my voice and shap@@ ed my identity as a mu@@ sici@@ an .
N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el A@@ y@@ ers was a double bas@@ si@@ st at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , but he suffer@@ ed a series of psycho@@ tic epi@@ so@@ des in his early 20@@ s , was treated with th@@ or@@ azine at B@@ el@@ lev@@ ue , and ended up living hom@@ eless on the streets of S@@ kid R@@ ow in down@@ town Los Angeles 30 years later .
N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el &apos;s story has become a be@@ a@@ con for hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and mental health ad@@ voc@@ acy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The So@@ lo@@ ist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his vi@@ o@@ lin teacher , and I told him that wher@@ ever he had his vi@@ o@@ lin , and wher@@ ever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
And on the many times I saw N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el on S@@ kid R@@ ow , I wit@@ n@@ essed how music was able to bring him back from his very dar@@ k@@ est moments , from what seemed to me in my un@@ trained eye to be the begin@@ n@@ ings of a sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic epi@@ so@@ de .
P@@ l@@ aying for N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that regi@@ ster@@ ed at a fundament@@ ally prim@@ al level in N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el &apos;s psy@@ che , yet came as a true musical offer@@ ing from me .
I found myself growing ou@@ tr@@ aged that someone like N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el could have ever been hom@@ eless on S@@ kid R@@ ow because of his mental ill@@ ness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on S@@ kid R@@ ow alone who had stories as trag@@ ic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had ch@@ os@@ en me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very n@@ ai@@ ve sense , I felt what S@@ kid R@@ ow really needed was somebody like Paul F@@ arm@@ er and not another clas@@ sical mu@@ sici@@ an playing on B@@ un@@ ker H@@ ill .
But in the end , it was N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instru@@ ment to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Ro@@ man@@ tic Ger@@ man com@@ pos@@ er Robert Sch@@ u@@ man@@ n , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the dar@@ k@@ ness of men &apos;s hear@@ ts , such is the du@@ ty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant quote because Sch@@ u@@ man@@ n himself suffer@@ ed from sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia and died in as@@ y@@ lum .
And inspired by what I learned from N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el , I started an organization on S@@ kid R@@ ow of mu@@ sici@@ ans called Street Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony , bringing the light of music into the very dar@@ k@@ est places , perform@@ ing for the hom@@ eless and ment@@ ally ill at shel@@ ters and clin@@ ics on S@@ kid R@@ ow , perform@@ ing for comb@@ at veter@@ ans with post-@@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order , and for the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated and those lab@@ el@@ ed as crimin@@ ally in@@ san@@ e .
After one of our events at the P@@ att@@ on S@@ tate Ho@@ sp@@ ital in San Ber@@ nar@@ d@@ ino , a woman walked up to us and she had t@@ ears stre@@ aming down her face , and she had a pal@@ sy , she was sha@@ king , and she had this gor@@ ge@@ ous s@@ mile , and she said that she had never heard clas@@ sical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a vi@@ o@@ lin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sun@@ sh@@ ine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped sha@@ king without medic@@ ation .
Sud@@ denly , what we &apos;re finding with these concer@@ ts , away from the stage , away from the foot@@ lights , out of the tu@@ x@@ edo ta@@ ils , the mu@@ sici@@ ans become the condu@@ it for deli@@ vering the tremendous ther@@ ape@@ u@@ tic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
Just as medicine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music trans@@ c@@ ends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our bel@@ o@@ ved ac@@ r@@ on@@ y@@ m .
Music trans@@ c@@ ends the a@@ es@@ thetic beauty alone .
The syn@@ chr@@ ony of emotions that we experience when we hear an oper@@ a by W@@ ag@@ ner , or a sym@@ ph@@ ony by Bra@@ h@@ ms , or cha@@ mber music by Be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven , comp@@ els us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply commun@@ al connected consciousness , the em@@ path@@ ic consciousness that neuro@@ psy@@ chi@@ atr@@ ist I@@ ain Mc@@ G@@ il@@ ch@@ ri@@ st says is har@@ d-@@ wi@@ red into our brain &apos;s right h@@ emis@@ p@@ here .
And for those living in the most de@@ human@@ iz@@ ing conditions of mental ill@@ ness within hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beauty of music offer@@ s a chance for them to trans@@ c@@ end the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not for@@ gotten them .
And the s@@ park of that beauty , the s@@ park of that humanity transform@@ s into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must in@@ still within our communities , within our audi@@ ences , if we want to inspi@@ re heal@@ ing from within .
I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Ke@@ ats , the Ro@@ man@@ tic English po@@ et , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
Ke@@ ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pur@@ su@@ e poe@@ try , but he died when he was a year older than me .
And Ke@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; Be@@ auty is truth , and truth beauty .
That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and A@@ my in particular .
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not sle@@ p@@ t in weeks .
N@@ ei@@ l and I were sitting there compar@@ ing how little we &apos;ve sle@@ p@@ t in anticip@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 8@@ 26 Val@@ encia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
B@@ ack in about 2000 , I was living in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , I was trying to finish my first book , I was w@@ ander@@ ing around da@@ zed every day because I wrote from 12 a@@ .@@ m. to 5 a@@ .@@ m.
So I would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
I had no mental acu@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
In the Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n neighborhood that I lived in , Par@@ k S@@ lo@@ pe , there are a lot of writ@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per cap@@ ita r@@ ati@@ o of writ@@ ers to normal people .
Me@@ an@@ while , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and constantly inspir@@ ing people I knew .
But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the strugg@@ les they were dealing with .
And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
Now , so many of these students had come from hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds where English isn &apos;t spo@@ ken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning dis@@ abilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fun@@ ded .
And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-@@ on-@@ one attention , more hours , more exper@@ ti@@ se from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-@@ on-@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-@@ on-@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five clas@@ ses of 30 to 40 students each .
This can lead up to 150 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day .
How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-@@ on-@@ one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to great@@ ly multi@@ ply the work@@ week and cl@@ one the teachers .
And so we started talking about this .
And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writ@@ ers , edi@@ tors , journ@@ alists , graduate students , as@@ sist@@ ant profes@@ sor@@ s , you name it .
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the prim@@ acy of the written word in terms of nur@@ tur@@ ing a democracy , nur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed life .
And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a condu@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
So when I moved back to San Francisco , we r@@ ented this building .
And the idea was to put Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other mag@@ az@@ ines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
It used to be in my kitch@@ en in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ tor@@ ing center .
So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writ@@ ers and edi@@ tors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written home@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
You give those hours in the after@@ no@@ on to the students in the neighborhood .
So , we had this place , we r@@ ented it , the land@@ l@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this mur@@ al , that &apos;s a Chris W@@ are mur@@ al , that basically expla@@ ins the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in mur@@ al form — it takes a long time to dig@@ est and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
So we r@@ ented this space .
And everything was great except the land@@ l@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zon@@ ed for re@@ tail ; you have to come up with something .
You &apos;ve got@@ ta sell something .
You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
It used to be a weight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors below , aco@@ us@@ tic ti@@ le ce@@ il@@ ings and flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ent lights .
We took all that down , and we found beautiful wo@@ o@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed be@@ ams and it had the look — while we were renov@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hu@@ ll of a ship . &quot;
And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell sup@@ pli@@ es to the working bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody lau@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
Let &apos;s sell pi@@ rate sup@@ pli@@ es . &quot; &quot; This is the pi@@ rate supply store .
You see , this is sort of a sk@@ et@@ ch I did on a n@@ ap@@ k@@ in .
A great car@@ p@@ enter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pi@@ rate sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ like .
Here you see plan@@ ks sold by the foot and we have sup@@ pli@@ es to comb@@ at s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
We have the pe@@ g legs there , that are all hand@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you .
U@@ p at the top , you see the ey@@ ep@@ atch dis@@ play , which is the black colum@@ n there for everyday use for your ey@@ ep@@ atch , and then you have the past@@ el and other colors for st@@ ep@@ ping out at night — special oc@@ c@@ asi@@ ons , bar mit@@ z@@ v@@ ah@@ s and whatever .
So we opened this place . And this is a v@@ at that we fill with tre@@ as@@ ures that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ ement eyes in case you lose one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; Pr@@ ac@@ tical Jo@@ king with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
Whi@@ le you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a ro@@ pe behind the coun@@ ter and eight mo@@ p heads drop on your head .
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s heads .
It became mo@@ p heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a sal@@ tw@@ ater t@@ ank with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ tor@@ ing center .
So right there is the tu@@ tor@@ ing center , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s offic@@ es , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book edi@@ ting and things like that .
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renov@@ ating this place .
We had t@@ ables , cha@@ irs , computers , everything .
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ com au@@ c@@ tion at a Ho@@ li@@ day In@@ n in Pal@@ o Al@@ to and I bought 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a str@@ o@@ ke of a pad@@ dle .
Any@@ way , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited .
It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writ@@ ers in the neighborhood .
And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. we put a sand@@ w@@ ich board out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree Tu@@ tor@@ ing for Your Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ rit@@ ing@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated Ne@@ eds — Just Come In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re gon@@ na love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
And so we wa@@ ited , we sat at the t@@ ables , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited .
And everybody was becoming very dis@@ cour@@ aged because it was weeks and weeks that we wa@@ ited , really , where nobody came in .
And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pi@@ rate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
And so then , around that time , I persu@@ aded a woman named N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h Cali@@ gar@@ i , a long@@ time San Francisco educ@@ ator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
She took over as execu@@ tive director .
Im@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ roads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
And what we were trying to offer every day was one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
The goal was to have a one-@@ to-@@ one r@@ ati@@ o with every one of these students .
You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-@@ on-@@ one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
And so most of these students , English is not spo@@ ken in the home .
They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ urch pe@@ w that I bought in a Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey au@@ c@@ tion right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red .
So that was the basis of it , was one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
If you &apos;re on Val@@ encia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m. , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ p@@ acks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
But there was something psycho@@ logical happening there that was just a little bit different .
And the other thing was , there was no sti@@ g@@ ma .
Ki@@ ds weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ enter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s-@@ T@@ hat@@ -@@ Ne@@ ed@@ -@@ Mo@@ re-@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 26 Val@@ encia .
First of all , it was a pi@@ rate supply store , which is in@@ san@@ e .
And then secon@@ dly , there &apos;s a publi@@ sh@@ ing company in the back .
And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same t@@ ables very often , and shoul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ shoul@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ n@@ ex@@ t-@@ to-@@ computer with the students .
And so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing center — publi@@ sh@@ ing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a no@@ vel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too .
So there &apos;s no sti@@ g@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re model@@ ing their behavior .
These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feed@@ s on each other .
There &apos;s a lot of cros@@ s-@@ poll@@ in@@ ation . The only problem , especially for the adults working at Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ ishing their home@@ work in a given day , working one-@@ on-@@ one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t st@@ all .
They don &apos;t do their home@@ work in front of the TV .
They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play .
And that makes a happy family .
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
A bunch of happy communities ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
So the key to it all is home@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
So we started off with about 12 volunte@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
And we now have 1,@@ 400 volunte@@ ers on our ro@@ ster .
And we make it incredibly easy to volunte@@ er .
The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ shoul@@ der , next to one student , concentr@@ ated attention , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-@@ expres@@ sion , is going to be absolutely transforma@@ tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps grew so fast .
Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in clas@@ ses during the day .
So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being ty@@ ped up above .
This is one of the clas@@ ses getting way too excited about writing .
You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
So this is one of the books that they do .
No@@ ti@@ ce the ti@@ tle of the book , &quot; The Bo@@ ok That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : Tit@@ anic . &quot;
And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named C@@ in@@ dy that was about the Tit@@ anic . &quot; &quot; So , mean@@ while , there &apos;s an adult in the back ty@@ ping this up , taking it completely seriously , which blo@@ ws their mind .
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a shot of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the events .
The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely mal@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us .
The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,@@ 400 people on our tu@@ tor ro@@ ster .
Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ un@@ days .
We &apos;re working on our college ess@@ ays . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wi@@ re : 1,@@ 400 tu@@ tors .
W@@ ho@@ ever can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
They work under the teacher &apos;s gui@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
And that &apos;s actually the br@@ un@@ t of what we do is , people going straight from their work@@ place , straight from home , straight into the class@@ room and working directly with the students .
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a class@@ room and you can st@@ af@@ f it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Ever@@ et@@ t Middle School W@@ rit@@ ers &apos; Ro@@ om , where we de@@ cor@@ ated it in bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ yle .
It &apos;s right off the libr@@ ary . And there we serve all 5@@ 29 kids in this middle school .
This is their new@@ sp@@ aper , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ai@@ ght-@@ U@@ p Ne@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going colum@@ n from May@@ or G@@ av@@ in New@@ so@@ m in both languages — English and S@@ pan@@ ish .
So then one day I@@ sab@@ el All@@ ende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sign a book with high school students ?
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ shall Hi@@ gh School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sign@@ ment to the students .
And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ sab@@ el All@@ ende is going to read all your ess@@ ays at the end .
She &apos;s going to publi@@ sh them in a book .
She &apos;s going to spon@@ sor the prin@@ ting of this book in pa@@ per@@ back form .
It &apos;s going to be available in all the boo@@ k@@ st@@ ores in the Bay A@@ rea and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was I@@ sab@@ el All@@ ende on the other end .
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
We had a big party at the end .
This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
You can see A@@ my T@@ an spon@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I M@@ ight G@@ et Some@@ where . &quot;
And this became an on@@ going thing . More and more books .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ dic@@ ted to the book thing .
The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be perman@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shel@@ f , know that nobody can di@@ min@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ ored their words , hon@@ ored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
It &apos;s absolutely transforma@@ tive .
And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the plan@@ ks .
We sell all the student books .
Where else would you put them , right ?
So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the st@@ ores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the store actually made money .
So it was paying the r@@ ent .
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to jud@@ ge .
But people would come in — and this was before the pi@@ rate movies and everything !
It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the r@@ ent , paying a fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time st@@ af@@ f mem@@ ber there .
There &apos;s the ocean ma@@ ps you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ ate@@ way to the community .
People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swe@@ ar on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red .
This is a field trip going on . And so they would be sho@@ pping , and they might be more likely to buy some lar@@ d , or mi@@ lle@@ t for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prot@@ ector for ni@@ ght@@ time , all of these things we sell .
So the store actually did really well .
But it brought in so many people — teachers , don@@ ors , volunte@@ ers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
It wasn &apos;t a non-@@ profit bur@@ i@@ ed , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th floor of some building down@@ town . It was right in the neighborhood that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public .
So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
So all the people I used to know in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
And a lot of them had been form@@ er educ@@ ators or w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be educ@@ ators , so they comb@@ ined with a lot of local designers , local writ@@ ers , and they just took the idea independ@@ ently and they did their own thing .
They didn &apos;t want to sell pi@@ rate sup@@ pli@@ es .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
So , knowing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fighting community in New York , they opened the Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n Su@@ per@@ h@@ ero Su@@ p@@ ply Com@@ p@@ any .
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ s@@ mit@@ h &apos;s sho@@ ps that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offer@@ ed , you know , all over there .
So they opened this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a Co@@ st@@ co for super@@ hero@@ es — all the sup@@ pli@@ es in kind of basic form .
These are all hand@@ made .
These are all sort of rep@@ ur@@ posed other products , or whatever .
All the pack@@ aging is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
So then you have the vill@@ ain con@@ tain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
This is a little v@@ aul@@ t — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter tells you that you have to reci@@ te the v@@ ow of hero@@ ism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it lim@@ its , really , their s@@ ales .
Per@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the products . These are all hand@@ made .
This is a secret identity k@@ it .
If you want to take on the identity of Sh@@ aron Bo@@ one , one American female marketing execu@@ tive from Ho@@ bo@@ ken , New Jer@@ sey . It &apos;s a full do@@ s@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about Sh@@ aron Bo@@ one .
So , this is the ca@@ per@@ y where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cape , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ grad@@ ed steps and then we turn on three hy@@ dr@@ au@@ lic f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is b@@ un@@ ching up or something like that .
So then , the secret door — this is one of the shel@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly open@@ s .
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grap@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ o@@ ks .
It open@@ s and then this is the tu@@ tor@@ ing center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
But this is — I just want to emp@@ ha@@ size — loc@@ ally fun@@ ded , loc@@ ally built .
All the designers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ ono .
I just came and visi@@ ted and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ ough@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours .
It &apos;s very bus@@ y . S@@ ame principles : one-@@ on-@@ one attention , complete de@@ vo@@ tion to the students &apos; work and a bo@@ und@@ less optimis@@ m and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
And this switch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re store , right ?
So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ shoul@@ der on t@@ ables , p@@ enci@@ ls and papers , whatever .
This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ dan .
You can read this quote .
Ad@@ dic@@ ted to video games and TV . C@@ ouldn &apos;t concentr@@ ate at home .
C@@ ame in . Go@@ t this concentr@@ ated attention .
And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his home@@ work early — got really ad@@ dic@@ ted to fin@@ ishing his home@@ work early .
It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it chec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
So he got ho@@ o@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things .
He &apos;s now been published in five books .
He co-@@ wrote a mo@@ ck@@ u@@ ment@@ ary about failed super@@ hero@@ es called &quot; &quot; Su@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ Be@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Pen@@ gu@@ in Bal@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — pen@@ gu@@ in .
And then he read al@@ oud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony S@@ pace , at a benefit for 8@@ 26 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
He &apos;s ev@@ an@@ ge@@ lic@@ al about it . He brings his co@@ us@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
This is L@@ .@@ A. , The E@@ cho Par@@ k Ti@@ me Tra@@ vel Mar@@ t : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ enever You Are , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven for time travel@@ ers .
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
Le@@ ech@@ es . M@@ am@@ mot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ l@@ ur@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of Or@@ der . Come B@@ ack Y@@ esterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Any@@ way . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
These are spaces that are only af@@ fi@@ li@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : Wor@@ d St@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ field , M@@ ass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ po@@ t in C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ at@@ i ; Y@@ outh S@@ pe@@ aks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Stu@@ dio St@@ . L@@ ou@@ is in St@@ . L@@ ou@@ is ; A@@ usti@@ n B@@ at C@@ ave in A@@ usti@@ n ; F@@ igh@@ ting Wor@@ ds in Du@@ bli@@ n , I@@ rel@@ and , started by Ro@@ d@@ dy D@@ oy@@ le , this will be open in A@@ pri@@ l .
Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that okay ?
All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED W@@ ish : I wish that you — you person@@ ally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transforma@@ tive part@@ ner@@ ships .
Pro@@ found le@@ aps forward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspi@@ re others on the website .
We created a website .
I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the atten@@ de@@ es of this conference will us@@ her in a new era of particip@@ ation in our public schools .
We hope that you will take the lead in part@@ ner@@ ing your innov@@ ative spirit and exper@@ ti@@ se with that of innov@@ ative educ@@ ators in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teachers lead the way .
They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and consul@@ t with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
So , this is with H@@ ot Stu@@ dio in San Francisco , they did this phenomen@@ al job .
This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once U@@ pon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great ti@@ tle , I think .
This site will docu@@ ment every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
H@@ ot Stu@@ dio did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ ad@@ line . So , visit the site .
If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and gui@@ de you through the process so that you can affect change .
And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it need@@ n &apos;t be st@@ eri@@ le . It need@@ n &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atically un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the skills that you have .
The schools need you . The teachers need you .
Stu@@ d@@ ents and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical person@@ hood and your open minds and open ears and bo@@ und@@ less compassion , sitting next to them , listening and no@@ d@@ ding and asking questions for hours at a time .
Some of these kids just don &apos;t pla@@ in know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
Thank you so much .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was sil@@ ent for 17 years .
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D@@ .C. , on the 20th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay .
And my family and friends had gather@@ ed there to hear me speak .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she ju@@ mp@@ ed up , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ j@@ ah , John@@ ny ’ s talking ! &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine if you were qui@@ et for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laugh@@ ed .
And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys .
Even though this one is kind of un@@ usual , I want you to think about your own journey .
My journey began in 197@@ 1 when I wit@@ n@@ essed two oil tan@@ kers col@@ li@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath the Gol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million gall@@ ons of oil spi@@ lled into the b@@ ay .
It dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and driving in mot@@ ori@@ zed vehic@@ les .
That ’ s a big thing in California .
And it was a big thing in my little community of Po@@ int Re@@ yes St@@ ation in In@@ ver@@ ness , California , because there were only about 3@@ 50 people there in the win@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now .
And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the poll@@ lu@@ tion .
And so I argu@@ ed with people about that , I argu@@ ed and I argu@@ ed .
I called my parents up .
I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
They ’ re back in Phi@@ l@@ adel@@ phi@@ a .
And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ thers are like that .
And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day I decided , because I argu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
And so I did .
I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
And what I heard , it kind of dist@@ ur@@ bed me .
Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
And in my mind , I just kind of r@@ ac@@ ed ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ ishing up .
And then I would la@@ unch in .
Well , that just ended communication .
So on this first day I actually listen@@ ed .
And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promis@@ ed myself for a year I would keep qui@@ et because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
So for a year I said I would keep qui@@ et , and then on my bir@@ th@@ day I would reas@@ s@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
Well , that l@@ ast@@ ed 17 years .
Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the ban@@ jo and I pain@@ ted and I wrote in my journ@@ al , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
I walked up to A@@ sh@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on , where they were offer@@ ing an environmental studies degree .
It ’ s only 500 miles .
And I went into the R@@ eg@@ istr@@ ar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
I had a new@@ sp@@ aper cli@@ pping .
&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
You don ’ t … ?
We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
And in those two years , I gradu@@ ated with my first degree — a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s degree .
And my father came out , he was so proud .
He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ isten , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s degree ?
You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my shoul@@ der , I picked my back@@ p@@ ack up again and I started walking .
I walked all the way up to Por@@ t To@@ w@@ n@@ send , Washington , where I built a wo@@ o@@ den boat , ro@@ de it across Pu@@ get S@@ ound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; I@@ da@@ h@@ o and down to Mis@@ sou@@ la , Mon@@ tan@@ a .
I had written the University of Mon@@ tan@@ a two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
There are two stories in Mon@@ tan@@ a .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one credit .
You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ vers and la@@ kes , the hydro@@ logical systems , South America .
So I did that .
He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve regi@@ ster@@ ed for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matr@@ icul@@ ate — you ’ re matr@@ icul@@ ating , so you can use the libr@@ ary .
And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the profes@@ sor@@ s allow you to go to class .
They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can regi@@ ster for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
And during that time , I actually taught clas@@ ses without speaking .
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
I expla@@ ined , with a friend who could interpre@@ t my sign language , that I was John Franci@@ s , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpre@@ ting for me .
All the students sat around and they went ...
( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the sch@@ ed@@ u@@ le , to see when they could get out .
They had to take that class with me .
Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
and they were all gather@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cu@@ tting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cu@@ tting . &quot;
&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cu@@ tting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a hand@@ saw . &quot;
&quot; Well , you can ’ t clear@@ cut with a ... &quot;
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about sel@@ ective for@@ estr@@ y . &quot;
Now this was a discus@@ sion class and we were having a discus@@ sion .
I just bac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fi@@ sts from flying .
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
And so I went on .
My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and driving and start talking .
What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my shoul@@ der , I got my back@@ p@@ ack and I went on to the University of W@@ is@@ con@@ sin .
I spent two years there writing on oil spi@@ lls .
No one was interested in oil spi@@ lls .
But something happened — Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez .
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spi@@ lls .
My dad came out again .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my back@@ p@@ ack again .
I put my ban@@ jo on and I walked all the way to the East Co@@ ast , put my foot in the At@@ lan@@ tic Oc@@ ean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
And on Earth D@@ ay , 199@@ 0 — the 20th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay — that ’ s when I began to speak .
And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest fall@@ ing ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me speak .
And that ’ s communication .
And they also taught me about listening — that they listen@@ ed to me .
And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the listening to each other .
Re@@ ally , very important — we need to listen to each other .
Well , my journey kept going on .
My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
I worked for the Co@@ ast@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . Go@@ od@@ will A@@ mb@@ ass@@ ador .
I wrote regul@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spi@@ ll regul@@ ations .
20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking e@@ ast ; get out of your car and just start walking e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shu@@ t up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bud@@ dy . &quot;
How could that be , how could that be ?
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
Well , my time at the Co@@ ast Gu@@ ard was a really good time .
And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ boat and I sa@@ iled down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and walked through all of the is@@ lands , and to Ven@@ ez@@ u@@ ela .
And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
I started talking because I had studied environment .
I ’ d studied environment at this form@@ al level , but there was this infor@@ mal level .
And the infor@@ mal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and end@@ an@@ ger@@ ed species to being about how we treated each other .
Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
And so that ’ s the message that I had .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ boat , sa@@ iled all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ boat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Ven@@ ez@@ u@@ ela and I started walking .
This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in mot@@ ori@@ zed vehic@@ les .
I was walking through El D@@ or@@ ado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or inf@@ am@@ ous prison — in Ven@@ ez@@ u@@ ela , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ s@@ essed me , because this was not like me .
There I am , walking past the gu@@ ard gate and the gu@@ ard stop@@ s and says , &quot; &quot; Pas@@ a@@ porte , pas@@ a@@ porte , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 16 pointed at me .
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Pas@@ s@@ port , hu@@ h ?
I don &apos;t need to show you my pass@@ port . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ack .
I &apos;m Dr. Franci@@ s ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ mb@@ ass@@ ador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
What pos@@ s@@ essed me to say this thing ?
The road turned into the jun@@ g@@ le .
I didn ’ t get shot .
And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — thank God Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pri@@ son@@ er .
I was a pri@@ son@@ er and I needed to escape .
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use mot@@ ori@@ zed vehic@@ les .
Now how could that be ?
Because when I started , it seemed very appropri@@ ate to me not to use mot@@ ori@@ zed vehic@@ les .
But the thing that was different was that every bir@@ th@@ day , I asked myself about sil@@ ence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
I had no idea I was going to become a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ mb@@ ass@@ ador .
I had no idea I would have a Ph@@ .@@ D.
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
And so , I want to encour@@ age you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
We have to change now .
As our form@@ er V@@ ice President said , we have to become activi@@ sts .
So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
And I know that all of you have tou@@ ched me while I ’ ve been here .
So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of sil@@ ence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the lat@@ est epi@@ so@@ de of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — long@@ est running so@@ ap oper@@ a , which is cr@@ ick@@ et .
And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal so@@ ap oper@@ a to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , s@@ ad@@ ness , t@@ ears , l@@ aughter , lots of dec@@ e@@ it , in@@ tri@@ gue .
And like all good so@@ aps , it ju@@ m@@ ps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
And that &apos;s exactly what cr@@ ick@@ et has done .
It &apos;s ju@@ mp@@ ed 20 years into 20@@ -@@ over game .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
C@@ r@@ ick@@ et wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ driven generations game .
There was a time when you played cr@@ ick@@ et , you played ti@@ mel@@ ess test mat@@ ches , when you played on till the game got over .
And there was this game in Mar@@ ch 19@@ 3@@ 9 that started on the third of Mar@@ ch and ended on the 14@@ th of Mar@@ ch .
And it only ended because the English cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters had to go from Dur@@ ban to Cap@@ e To@@ wn , which is a two-@@ hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17@@ th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
So , the match was ended in between .
And one of the English bat@@ sm@@ en said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
There were two S@@ un@@ days in between . But of course , S@@ un@@ days are ch@@ urch days , so you don &apos;t play on S@@ un@@ days . And one day it ra@@ ined , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cr@@ ick@@ et : because we had about the same pace of life .
( Laughter ) The Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
You f@@ ought by day , then it was sun@@ set , so everyone went back home .
And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and f@@ ought the next day , and you went back home again .
The only difference between the Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata and our cr@@ ick@@ et was that in cr@@ ick@@ et , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
Pr@@ in@@ ces patr@@ oniz@@ e the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingr@@ ati@@ ating themselves to the British r@@ ul@@ ers .
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cr@@ ick@@ et , which was , all you needed was a plan@@ k of wood and a ru@@ b@@ ber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
Take a look : You could play it in the du@@ mp with some ro@@ cks over there , you could play it in a little al@@ ley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the b@@ at hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air condi@@ tion@@ ing and the cable w@@ ir@@ es .
( Laughter ) You could play it on the ban@@ ks of the G@@ an@@ ges — that &apos;s as clean as the G@@ an@@ ges has been for a long time .
Or you could play many games in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 5@@ 0-@@ over cr@@ ick@@ et .
And then an enormous accident took place .
In Indian s@@ port we don &apos;t make things happen , accid@@ ents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
And we won this World C@@ up in 198@@ 3 .
And suddenly we fell in love with the 5@@ 0-@@ over game , and we played it vir@@ tually every day .
There was more 5@@ 0-@@ over cr@@ ick@@ et than anywhere .
But there was another big date .
198@@ 3 was when we won the World C@@ up .
199@@ 1 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a fin@@ ance min@@ ister and a prime min@@ ister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of in@@ tri@@ gue and myst@@ ery in this closed country .
And so we allowed mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als into India .
We cut cust@@ oms du@@ ties , we reduc@@ ed im@@ port du@@ ties , and we got all the mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als coming in , with mul@@ tin@@ ational bud@@ gets , who looked at per@@ -@@ cap@@ ita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
And there are only two vehic@@ les in India — one real , one scrip@@ ted .
The scrip@@ ted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cr@@ ick@@ et .
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , R@@ av@@ i D@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from P@@ ep@@ si , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
And P@@ ep@@ si was this big revolution , because they started taking cr@@ ick@@ et all over .
And so cr@@ ick@@ et started becoming big ; cr@@ ick@@ et started bringing r@@ ich@@ es in .
T@@ el@@ evi@@ sion started co@@ vering cr@@ ick@@ et . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cr@@ ick@@ et unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 5@@ 5 million dollars .
The next rights are sold for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a cur@@ ve , that .
And then another big accident happened in our cr@@ ick@@ et .
England invented 20 over@@ s cr@@ ick@@ et , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 over@@ s cr@@ ick@@ et . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cr@@ ick@@ et , and made the rest of the world play it .
Thank God for them .
( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up , you see .
India didn &apos;t want to play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up .
But we were forced to play it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ gin .
And then something very dram@@ atic happened .
We got to the final , and then this moment , that will re@@ main en@@ sh@@ r@@ ined forever , for everybody , take a look .
( C@@ ro@@ w@@ d che@@ ering ) The Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ i bat@@ s@@ man trying to clear the fiel@@ der .
An@@ no@@ un@@ cer : And Z@@ is@@ han takes it ! India w@@ ins !
What a match for a Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ 20 final .
India , the world cha@@ mpi@@ ons .
( Che@@ ering ) India , T@@ 20 cha@@ mpi@@ ons .
But what a game we had , M@@ . S. D@@ hon@@ i got it right in the air , but Mis@@ b@@ ah@@ -@@ ul@@ -@@ Ha@@ q , what a play@@ er .
A massive , massive success : India , the world T@@ T cha@@ mpi@@ ons .
Har@@ sh@@ a B@@ ho@@ g@@ le : Sud@@ denly India discovered this power of 20@@ -@@ over@@ s cr@@ ick@@ et .
The accident , of course , there , was that the bat@@ s@@ man thought the bo@@ w@@ ler was bo@@ w@@ ling fast .
( Laughter ) If he had bo@@ w@@ led fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
And what it also did was it led to a certain pri@@ de in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confid@@ ent about itself .
And so there was a feeling that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
And th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for all of us , the English are very good at invent@@ ing things , and then the graci@@ ous people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
( Laughter ) And so England invented T@@ 20 cr@@ ick@@ et , and allowed India to hi@@ j@@ ack it .
It was not like re@@ engineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T@@ 20 le@@ agu@@ e .
Si@@ x weeks , city versus city .
It was a new thing for us . We had only ever sup@@ port@@ ed our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , represent@@ ing itself on the field .
One was war , the Indian ar@@ my , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
The other was Indian cr@@ ick@@ et .
Now , suddenly we had to support city le@@ agu@@ es .
But the people getting into these city le@@ agu@@ es were people who were taking their cu@@ es from the West .
America is a home of le@@ agu@@ es . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some gli@@ t@@ z@@ y le@@ agu@@ es here in India . &quot;
But was India ready for it ?
Because cr@@ ick@@ et , for a long time in India was always organized .
It was never promot@@ ed , it was never sold — it was organized .
And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
All of a sudden , you had that happening .
( Music ) An opening cer@@ em@@ ony to match every other .
This was an India that was bu@@ ying Cor@@ v@@ et@@ tes . This was an India that was bu@@ ying J@@ agu@@ ar .
This was an India that was ad@@ ding more mobile phones per month than New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and &apos;s population twice over .
So , it was a different India .
But it was also a slightly more or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
And so , they were ag@@ ha@@ st when the che@@ er@@ leaders arrived .
Every@@ one secre@@ tly watched them , but everyone cl@@ aim@@ ed not to .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new ow@@ ners of Indian cr@@ ick@@ et were not the old prin@@ ces .
They were not bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ ats who were forced into s@@ port because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
And so they started promot@@ ing cr@@ ick@@ et big time , started promot@@ ing clu@@ bs big time .
And they &apos;ve started promot@@ ing them with huge money behind it .
I mean the I@@ P@@ L had 2.@@ 3 billion dollars before a ball was bo@@ w@@ led , 1.@@ 6 billion dollars for television re@@ ven@@ ue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es that were putting in money . And then they had to appe@@ al to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up le@@ agu@@ es .
But what they were very good at doing was making it very loc@@ alized .
So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Man@@ ch@@ est@@ er United st@@ yle pro@@ motion , but very Mu@@ mb@@ ai st@@ yle pro@@ motion . Take a look .
( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cr@@ ick@@ et .
All along , if you wanted a young cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter , you picked him up from the b@@ y@@ lan@@ es of your own little lo@@ cal@@ ity , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters .
Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bo@@ w@@ l a shot — if Mu@@ mb@@ ai were to bo@@ w@@ l a shot , for example , they need@@ n &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ b@@ ad@@ ev@@ i or S@@ hi@@ v@@ aj@@ i Par@@ k or somewhere to source them , they could go to Tr@@ ini@@ dad .
This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
And all of a sudden , Indian s@@ port had aw@@ ak@@ en@@ ed to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
So , the Mu@@ mb@@ ai Indi@@ ans fle@@ w in D@@ w@@ ay@@ ne Bra@@ vo from Tr@@ ini@@ dad and T@@ ob@@ ago , over@@ night . And when he had to go back to represent the West In@@ dies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X@@ . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , you play to date X , min@@ us one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , straight after the game ,
went from the st@@ adi@@ um to Hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad air@@ port , sat in a private corpor@@ ate j@@ et — first refu@@ el@@ ing in Por@@ tu@@ g@@ al , second refu@@ el@@ ing in Brazil ; he was in West In@@ dies in time .
( Laughter ) N@@ ever would India have thought on this scale before .
N@@ ever would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a play@@ er to play one game for me , and I will use a corpor@@ ate j@@ et to send him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ ston , J@@ am@@ a@@ ica to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ r@@ ying the two most important things in Indian cr@@ ick@@ et , which is cr@@ ick@@ et and the movies in Indian enter@@ tain@@ ment .
There is cr@@ ick@@ et and the movies .
And they came together because people in the movies now started ow@@ ning clu@@ bs .
And so , people started going to the cr@@ ick@@ et to watch Pre@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta .
They started going to the cr@@ ick@@ et to watch Sha@@ h Ru@@ k@@ h K@@ han .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting song and dance in Indian cr@@ ick@@ et .
And so it started res@@ em@@ bling the Indian movies more and more .
And of course , if you were on Pre@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that fol@@ lo@@ ws — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from Pre@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta .
So that was the ulti@@ mate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching Pre@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta .
( Music ) And then of course there was Sha@@ h Ru@@ k@@ h playing the K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata crow@@ d .
We &apos;d all seen mat@@ ches in K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Sha@@ h Ru@@ k@@ h , with the B@@ eng@@ al@@ i song , getting the audi@@ ences all worked up for K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata — not for India , but for K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata .
But take a look at this .
( Music ) An Indian film star hu@@ g@@ ging a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ i cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter because they &apos;d won in K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata .
Can you imagine ?
And do you know what the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ i cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for Pre@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pak@@ istan in here .
I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
We can play cr@@ ick@@ et together , we can be friends .
So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pak@@ istan .
( Applause ) There was cri@@ tici@@ sm too because they said , &quot; &quot; P@@ lay@@ ers are being bought and sold ?
Are they gr@@ ain ?
Are they cat@@ tle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this au@@ c@@ tion , you see .
How do you fix a price for a play@@ er ?
And so the au@@ c@@ tion that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so@@ -@@ and-@@ so play@@ er . &quot;
There it is .
( Music ) A@@ uc@@ tion@@ e@@ er : Go@@ ing at 1,@@ 5@@ 00,000 dollars . Ch@@ en@@ na@@ i .
S@@ han@@ e W@@ ar@@ ne sold for 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars .
H@@ B : Sud@@ denly , a game which ear@@ ned its play@@ ers 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day — so 250 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
The best Indian play@@ ers who played every test match — every one of the intern@@ ation@@ als , the top of the line play@@ ers — standard contr@@ acts are 2@@ 20@@ ,000 dollars in a whole year .
Now they were getting 5@@ 00,000 for six days &apos; work .
Then An@@ drew F@@ lin@@ to@@ ff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than Frank L@@ am@@ par@@ d and St@@ even G@@ err@@ ard , and I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than the foot@@ ball@@ ers , w@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And where was he ear@@ ning it from ? From a little clu@@ b in India .
Could you have imagin@@ ed that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
So , at 2.@@ 3 billion dollars before the first ball was bo@@ w@@ led .
What India was doing , though , was ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
L@@ al@@ it Mo@@ di was on the cover of Bus@@ iness Today .
I@@ P@@ L became the biggest brand in India and , because our elec@@ tions , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent in three weeks .
Mo@@ ve a whole t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent to South Africa in three weeks .
But we did it . You know why ?
Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest as@@ set because there were more people watching — the huge consu@@ ming class — everybody came to watch the cr@@ ick@@ et .
We &apos;d also made cr@@ ick@@ et the only s@@ port in India , which is a p@@ ity , but in India every other s@@ port push@@ es cr@@ ick@@ et to become big , which is a bit of a trag@@ edy of our times .
Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
For a long time , India was this country of poverty , d@@ ust , be@@ g@@ gar@@ s , sn@@ ake char@@ mers , fil@@ th , Del@@ hi bel@@ ly — people heard Del@@ hi bel@@ ly stories before they came .
And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
C@@ ric@@ ke@@ ters all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
And that felt good , you know ?
We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Del@@ hi bel@@ ly in there anymore .
There &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no be@@ g@@ gar@@ s , all the sn@@ ake char@@ mers have van@@ ished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capit@@ alist world rules .
Right so , finally , an English game that India us@@ ur@@ ped a little bit , but T@@ 20 is going to be the next mis@@ sion@@ ary in the world .
If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shor@@ test form of the game .
You can &apos;t take a ti@@ mel@@ ess test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
So that &apos;s what T@@ 20 is doing .
Ho@@ pe@@ fully , it &apos;ll make everyone ric@@ her , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cr@@ ick@@ et com@@ ment@@ ators more time in the business .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
( Applause )
So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Jap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is O@@ ak Street , that &apos;s El@@ m Street .
This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
Stre@@ ets have names ; blocks are just the un@@ named spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little conf@@ used and dis@@ ap@@ pointed .
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lock 17 and this is B@@ lock 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
B@@ loc@@ ks have names .
Just look at Google M@@ aps here . There &apos;s B@@ lock 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the un@@ named spaces in between the blocks .
And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ istr@@ ic@@ t E@@ ight .
There &apos;s B@@ lock 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assu@@ mp@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical ph@@ rase : one , two , three , four .
But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ rase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ ras@@ ing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also accur@@ ate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
Do@@ mo ari@@ g@@ ato go@@ z@@ aim@@ ash@@ ita .
B@@ eli@@ eve me or not , I come offer@@ ing a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requi@@ site focus on climate .
And the solution I offer is to the biggest cul@@ pr@@ it in this massive mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of the earth by human@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting dec@@ line of the bio@@ sphere .
That cul@@ pr@@ it is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 5@@ 2 years since my gradu@@ ation from Geor@@ gi@@ a T@@ ech in 195@@ 6 .
As an industrial engineer , cu@@ m aspir@@ ing and then successful entreprene@@ ur .
After foun@@ ding my company , Inter@@ face , from scr@@ atch in 197@@ 3 , 3@@ 6 years ago , to produce car@@ pet tiles in America for the business and institu@@ tion markets , and sh@@ ep@@ her@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and survival to prosper@@ ity and global domin@@ ance in its field , I read Paul Haw@@ ken &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ co@@ logy of Com@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the summer of 199@@ 4 .
In his book , Paul char@@ ges business and industry as , one , the major cul@@ pr@@ it in ca@@ using the dec@@ line of the bio@@ sphere , and , two , the only institu@@ tion that is large enough , and per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve enough , and powerful enough , to really lead human@@ kind out of this m@@ ess .
And by the way he convic@@ ted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the earth .
And I then challen@@ ged the people of Inter@@ face , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustain@@ ability , which we defined as eventually operating our pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ inten@@ sive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be ren@@ e@@ wed by the earth , natur@@ ally and rapi@@ dly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no har@@ m to the bio@@ sphere .
Take nothing : do no har@@ m .
I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Haw@@ ken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
Un@@ less somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a@@ xi@@ o@@ matic . Why not us ?
And th@@ anks to the people of Inter@@ face , I have become a reco@@ vering pl@@ under@@ er .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a For@@ tun@@ e Mag@@ azine writ@@ er that some@@ day people like me would go to j@@ ail .
And that became the head@@ line of a For@@ tun@@ e article .
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s green@@ est CE@@ O .
From pl@@ under@@ er to reco@@ vering pl@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s green@@ est CE@@ O in five years — that , fran@@ kly , was a pretty sad com@@ ment@@ ary on American CE@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 .
As@@ ked later in the Can@@ adi@@ an document@@ ary , &quot; &quot; The Cor@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to j@@ ail &quot; &quot; re@@ mark , I offer@@ ed that the@@ ft is a crime .
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a crime .
But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstr@@ able alternative to the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ ma@@ ke@@ -@@ waste industrial system that so domin@@ ates our civilization , and is the major cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ aling our children &apos;s future , by dig@@ ging up the earth and conver@@ ting it to products that quickly become waste in a land@@ fill or an inc@@ in@@ er@@ ator — in short , dig@@ ging up the earth and conver@@ ting it to pollu@@ tion .
Ac@@ cording to Paul and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a well-@@ known environmental impact equ@@ ation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , af@@ flu@@ ence and technology .
That is , impact is gener@@ ated by people , what they consu@@ me in their af@@ flu@@ ence , and how it is produced .
And though the equ@@ ation is larg@@ ely subj@@ ective , you can perhaps qu@@ anti@@ fy people , and perhaps qu@@ anti@@ fy af@@ flu@@ ence , but technology is abu@@ sive in too many ways to qu@@ anti@@ fy .
So the equ@@ ation is concep@@ tual .
S@@ till it works to help us understand the problem .
So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to transform the way we made car@@ pet , a pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ inten@@ sive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they di@@ min@@ ished environmental impact , rather than multi@@ pli@@ ed it .
Paul and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environmental impact equ@@ ation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , af@@ flu@@ ence and technology .
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ write that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ .
Now , the mathemati@@ call@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see immediately that T in the numer@@ ator incre@@ ases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denomin@@ ator dec@@ reas@@ es impact .
So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numer@@ ator — call it T@@ 1 — where it incre@@ ases impact , to the denomin@@ ator — call it T@@ 2 — where it redu@@ ces impact ?
I thought about the character@@ is@@ tics of first industrial revolution , T@@ 1 , as we practic@@ ed it at Inter@@ face , and it had the following character@@ is@@ tics .
Ex@@ trac@@ tive : taking ra@@ w materials from the earth .
Lin@@ ear : take , make , waste .
Po@@ wer@@ ed by fos@@ sil fu@@ el@@ -@@ deri@@ ved energy .
W@@ a@@ ste@@ ful : abu@@ sive and focused on labor produc@@ tivity .
More car@@ pet per man@@ -@@ hour .
Th@@ inking it through , I realized that all those at@@ tribu@@ tes must be changed to move T to the denomin@@ ator .
In the new industrial revolution extr@@ active must be re@@ placed by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able ; lin@@ ear by cy@@ clic@@ al ; fos@@ sil fuel energy by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , sun@@ light ; wa@@ ste@@ ful by wa@@ ste@@ -@@ free ; and abu@@ sive by ben@@ ign ; and labor produc@@ tivity by resour@@ ce produc@@ tivity .
And I reas@@ oned that if we could make those transforma@@ tive changes , and get rid of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
And that became the Inter@@ face plan in 199@@ 5 , and has been the plan ever since .
We have measu@@ red our progress very ri@@ gor@@ ously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et green@@ house gas emissions down 8@@ 2 percent in absolu@@ te ton@@ n@@ age .
( Applause ) Over the same sp@@ an of time s@@ ales have increas@@ ed by two-@@ thir@@ ds and prof@@ its have dou@@ bled .
So an 8@@ 2 percent absolu@@ te reduc@@ tion transl@@ ates into a 90 percent reduc@@ tion in green@@ house gas intensi@@ ty rel@@ ative to s@@ ales .
This is the magn@@ itu@@ de of the reduc@@ tion the entire global tech@@ no@@ sphere must realize by 20@@ 50 to avoid cat@@ astr@@ op@@ hic climate disrup@@ tion — so the scientists are telling us .
F@@ os@@ sil fuel us@@ age is down 60 percent per un@@ it of production , due to effici@@ encies in ren@@ e@@ w@@ ables .
The che@@ ap@@ est , most sec@@ ure bar@@ re@@ l of oil there is is the one not used through effici@@ encies .
W@@ ater us@@ age is down 75 percent in our world@@ wide car@@ pet ti@@ le business .
D@@ own 40 percent in our broad@@ loo@@ m car@@ pet business , which we ac@@ qui@@ red in 199@@ 3 right here in California , City of In@@ dus@@ try , where water is so preci@@ ous .
R@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able or recy@@ cl@@ able materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapi@@ dly .
R@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
We have diver@@ ted 14@@ 8 million pounds — that &apos;s 7@@ 4@@ ,000 tons — of used car@@ pet from land@@ fi@@ lls , clo@@ sing the loo@@ p on material flo@@ ws through re@@ verse log@@ is@@ tics and post-@@ consu@@ mer recy@@ cl@@ ing technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
Those new cy@@ clic@@ al technologies have contribu@@ ted mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square y@@ ards of cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ neutr@@ al car@@ pet since 2004 , meaning no net contribu@@ tion to global climate disrup@@ tion in producing the car@@ pet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ life re@@ cl@@ am@@ ation — independent thir@@ d-@@ party certi@@ fied .
We call it Co@@ ol Car@@ pet .
And it has been a powerful mark@@ et@@ place differ@@ enti@@ ator , increasing s@@ ales and prof@@ its .
Three years ago we launched car@@ pet ti@@ le for the home , under the brand Fl@@ or , mis@@ sp@@ el@@ led F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R .
You can point and click today at Fl@@ or@@ .com and have Co@@ ol Car@@ pet deli@@ vered to your front door in five days .
It is prac@@ tical , and pretty too .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ k@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our goal : zero impact , zero foot@@ print .
We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our target year for zero , for re@@ aching the top , the sum@@ mit of Moun@@ t S@@ ust@@ ain@@ ability .
We call this Mis@@ sion Z@@ ero .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found Mis@@ sion Z@@ ero to be incredibly good for business .
A better business model , a better way to bigger prof@@ its .
Here is the business case for sustain@@ ability .
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , refl@@ ecting some 400 million dollars of avo@@ id@@ ed costs in pur@@ suit of zero waste — the first face of Moun@@ t S@@ ust@@ ain@@ ability .
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Inter@@ face .
And this dis@@ pel@@ s a my@@ th too , this fal@@ se choice between the environment and the economy .
Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustain@@ ability , an un@@ expected well@@ spring of innovation .
Our people are gal@@ van@@ ized around this shared higher purpose .
You cannot beat it for at@@ trac@@ ting the best people and bringing them together .
And the go@@ od@@ will of the mark@@ et@@ place is ast@@ on@@ ishing .
No amount of adver@@ ti@@ sing , no cle@@ ver marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much go@@ od@@ will .
Co@@ sts , products , people , mark@@ et@@ places — what else is there ?
It is a better business model .
And here is our 14@@ -@@ year record of s@@ ales and prof@@ its .
There is a di@@ p there , from 2001 to 2003 : a di@@ p when our s@@ ales , over a three-@@ year period , were down 17 percent .
But the mark@@ et@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We literally g@@ ain@@ ed market share .
We might not have sur@@ vi@@ ved that rec@@ es@@ sion but for the advant@@ ages of sustain@@ ability .
If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing Inter@@ face plan@@ s , would that solve all our problems ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I re@@ main trou@@ bled by the revis@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ 2 .
That A is a capital A , sugg@@ esting that af@@ flu@@ ence is an end in itself .
But what if we re@@ fr@@ am@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch further ?
And what if we made A a low@@ er@@ case &apos; a , &apos; sugg@@ esting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
You know that would re@@ frame civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succe@@ eds us : the sustainable species , living on a fin@@ ite earth , eth@@ ically , happi@@ ly and eco@@ log@@ ically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the in@@ defini@@ te future .
But does the earth have to wait for our ext@@ inc@@ tion as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
At Inter@@ face we really inten@@ d to bring this prototy@@ pic@@ al sustainable , zer@@ o-@@ foot@@ print industrial company fully into existence by 20@@ 20 .
We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
And now the challenge is in execu@@ tion .
And as my good friend and ad@@ vi@@ ser A@@ mor@@ y Lo@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
If we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ inten@@ sive company can do it , anybody can .
And if anybody can , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that everybody can .
Haw@@ ken ful@@ filled business and industry , leading human@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with continu@@ ed un@@ chec@@ ked dec@@ line of the bio@@ sphere , a very de@@ ar person is at risk here — fran@@ kly , an un@@ accep@@ table risk .
Who is that person ?
Not you . Not I@@ .
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain cli@@ mb .
On a Tu@@ es@@ day morning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was conn@@ ecting .
But about five days later back in Atl@@ anta , I received an email from G@@ len@@ n Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
He was sending me an original po@@ em that he had com@@ posed after our Tu@@ es@@ day morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most u@@ pli@@ f@@ ting moments of my life .
Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
Here is what G@@ len@@ n wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
Please meet &quot; &quot; To@@ morrow &apos;s Chi@@ ld . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and knowing not your time or place , To@@ morrow &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last Tu@@ es@@ day mor@@ n .
A wise friend introduc@@ ed us two .
And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , somehow thre@@ aten you .
To@@ morrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just be@@ gun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
B@@ eg@@ in , I will .
The way the cost of what I squ@@ ander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; To@@ morrow &apos;s Chi@@ ld &quot; &quot; has spo@@ ken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presu@@ me to share with you .
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
The continu@@ um of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
And we have a choice to make during our bri@@ ef , bri@@ ef visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hur@@ t it or to help it .
For you , it &apos;s your call .
Thank you .
( Applause )
