By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that activ@@ ely use social net@@ working sites .
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
Whi@@ le that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really profound implic@@ ations that are worth explor@@ ing .
What first got me thinking about this was a blog pos@@ t auth@@ ored earlier this year by Der@@ ek K. M@@ ill@@ er , who was a science and technology journ@@ alist who died of cancer .
And what M@@ ill@@ er did was have his family and friends write a pos@@ t that went out shor@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last pos@@ t to my blog .
In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally shu@@ t down from the pun@@ ish@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archi@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journ@@ alist , M@@ ill@@ er &apos;s archi@@ ve may have been better written and more carefully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archi@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previ@@ ous generation .
Con@@ si@@ der a few st@@ ats for a moment .
Right now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being u@@ plo@@ aded to YouTube every single minute .
There are 200 million T@@ we@@ ets being pos@@ ted every day .
And the average Facebook us@@ er is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
So when you think about your parents or your grand@@ parents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box somewhere .
But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archi@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cloud in@@ definitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opportunities for technologi@@ sts .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journ@@ alist and not a technolog@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ ef@@ ly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online pro@@ file and our social media accoun@@ ts after we die .
One of them actually , f@@ it@@ t@@ ingly enough , found me when I chec@@ ked into a del@@ i at a restaurant in New York on four@@ square .
( Re@@ cording ) A@@ dam O@@ str@@ ow : H@@ ello .
De@@ ath : A@@ dam ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
De@@ ath : De@@ ath can catch you anywhere , any@@ time , even at the Organ@@ ic .
A@@ O : Who is this ?
De@@ ath : Go to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) A@@ dam O@@ str@@ ow : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?
So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be pos@@ ted to Facebook after you die .
Another service right now is called 1,000 M@@ em@@ ories .
And what this lets you do is create an online tribu@@ te to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can pos@@ t after you die .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with De@@ b R@@ oy who , back in Mar@@ ch , demonstr@@ ated how he was able to analy@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video .
I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amoun@@ ts of data continu@@ es to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analy@@ ze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the T@@ we@@ ets , the photos , the videos , the blog pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone th@@ anks to the v@@ ast@@ ness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
One service called My N@@ ext T@@ we@@ et analy@@ zes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted onto Twitter , to make some predic@@ tions as to what you might say next .
Well right now , as you can see , the results can be some@@ what com@@ ical .
You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical cap@@ abilities improve .
T@@ aking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique character@@ is@@ tics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produ@@ ces in their lifetime ?
Fin@@ ally , think back to this famous scene from elec@@ tion night 2008 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ logr@@ am of hi@@ p ho@@ p artist w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their studi@@ o for an inter@@ view with Anderson Co@@ op@@ er .
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to be@@ am a represent@@ ation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interac@@ ting in a very life@@ like way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both exp@@ and expon@@ enti@@ ally .
Now in clo@@ sing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
Thank you very much .

Thank you so much .
Thank you .
These are people who have taken career brea@@ ks for el@@ der care , for child@@ care reasons , pur@@ su@@ ing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
C@@ lo@@ sely related are career transi@@ tion@@ ers of all kinds : veter@@ ans , military spo@@ uses , reti@@ re@@ es coming out of reti@@ rement or re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ating exp@@ ats .
This dis@@ connect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
He &apos;s a nuclear physici@@ st in the U@@ K who took a fi@@ ve-@@ year career break to be home with his five children .
The S@@ ing@@ apo@@ re press recently wrote about nur@@ ses re@@ turning to work after long career brea@@ ks .
That &apos;s the long@@ est career break that I &apos;m aware of .
Tr@@ acy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
I met Tr@@ acy in J@@ une of 2011 , when the Today S@@ how asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around .
The first thing I told Tr@@ acy was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in re@@ turning to work .
I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversations that don &apos;t go anywhere .
Ex@@ p@@ ect that , and don &apos;t be dis@@ cour@@ aged by it .
And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is fro@@ zen in time .
What I mean by this is , when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past , the people with whom you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your career break .
And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has di@@ min@@ ished over time , as happens with so many of us the far@@ ther re@@ moved we are from our professional identi@@ ties .
So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this .
This is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my mini@@ van .
Or here I am in the kitch@@ en .
But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this .
They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great confid@@ ence boo@@ st to be back in touch with these people and hear their en@@ th@@ usias@@ m about your interest in re@@ turning to work .
And that was that I har@@ dly kept up with the business news .
My background is in fin@@ ance , and I har@@ dly kept up with any news when I was home car@@ ing for my four young children .
I believe rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are a ge@@ m of the work@@ force , and here &apos;s why .
Think about our life stage : for those of us who took career brea@@ ks for child@@ care reasons , we have fe@@ wer or no mat@@ ern@@ ity leaves .
We &apos;re in a more sett@@ led time of life .
We have great work experience .
We have a more mat@@ ure perspective .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employ@@ er &apos;s expen@@ se .
P@@ lus we have an energy , an en@@ th@@ usias@@ m about re@@ turning to work preci@@ sely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
On the fli@@ p side , I speak with employ@@ ers , and here are two concer@@ ns that employ@@ ers have about hi@@ ring rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
The first one is , employ@@ ers are worried that rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are technolog@@ ically ob@@ sole@@ te .
Now , I can tell you , having been technolog@@ ically ob@@ sole@@ te myself at one point , that it &apos;s a tempor@@ ary condition .
It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the com@@ man@@ ds are the same .
And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
And they do .
The second area of concer@@ n that employ@@ ers have about rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers is they &apos;re worried that rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers don &apos;t know what they want to do .
I tell rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interest@@ s and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
That &apos;s not the employ@@ er &apos;s job .
B@@ ack in 2010 I started notic@@ ing something .
I saw a re@@ turning engineer , a non@@ traditional re@@ entr@@ y candi@@ date , apply for an entr@@ y-@@ level intern@@ ship program in the military , and then get a perman@@ ent job after@@ ward .
I saw two universi@@ ties integr@@ ate intern@@ ships into mid@@ -@@ career execu@@ tive education programs .
And at this point , hundreds of people have particip@@ ated .
These intern@@ ships are paid , and the people who move on to perman@@ ent ro@@ les are com@@ man@@ ding competi@@ tive sal@@ aries .
And now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are pi@@ lot@@ ing re@@ entr@@ y intern@@ ship programs for re@@ turning engineers as part of an initi@@ ative with the So@@ ci@@ ety of Women En@@ gin@@ e@@ ers .
Now , why are companies embr@@ ac@@ ing the re@@ entr@@ y intern@@ ship ?
This testing out period re@@ moves the percei@@ ved risk that some man@@ agers att@@ ach to hi@@ ring rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , and they are at@@ trac@@ ting excel@@ l@@ ent candi@@ dat@@ es who are turning into great hi@@ res .
Think about how far we have come .
Be@@ fore this , most employ@@ ers were not interested in eng@@ aging with rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers at all .
But now , not only are programs being developed specifically with rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers in mind , but you can &apos;t even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your ré@@ sum@@ é .
This is the mark of real change , of true institu@@ tional shift , because if we can solve this problem for rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , we can solve it for other career transi@@ tion@@ ers too .
In fact , an employ@@ er just told me that their veter@@ ans return to work program is based on their re@@ entr@@ y intern@@ ship program .
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a reti@@ ree intern@@ ship program .
Di@@ f@@ fer@@ ent po@@ ol , same concept .
So let me tell you what happened with Tr@@ acy Sha@@ pir@@ o .
Rem@@ ember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in re@@ turning to work .
Well , one critical conversation with another par@@ ent in her community led to a job offer for Tr@@ acy , and it was an accoun@@ ting job in a fin@@ ance de@@ partment .
This was in the fall of 2011 .
Tr@@ acy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a perman@@ ent fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time role , she decided to take her chan@@ ces with this intern@@ ship and hope for the best .
F@@ ast forward to 20@@ 15 , Tr@@ acy &apos;s been promot@@ ed .
They &apos;ve paid for her to get her M@@ B@@ A at night .
She &apos;s even hi@@ red another rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ er to work for her .
Tr@@ acy &apos;s tem@@ p job was a tr@@ y@@ out , just like an intern@@ ship , and it ended up being a win for both Tr@@ acy and her employ@@ er .
Now , my goal is to bring the re@@ entr@@ y intern@@ ship concept to more and more employ@@ ers .
But in the mean@@ time , if you are re@@ turning to work after a career break , don &apos;t h@@ esit@@ ate to suggest an intern@@ ship or an intern@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like arr@@ ang@@ ement to an employ@@ er that does not have a form@@ al re@@ entr@@ y intern@@ ship program .
B@@ e their first success story , and you can be the example for more rel@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ers to come .
Thank you .

It was an after@@ no@@ on in the fall of 2005 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organization &apos;s science ad@@ vis@@ or .
So I w@@ ander@@ ed down the hall@@ way to my colleagu@@ e Chris H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s office .
Chris had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had deep institu@@ tional knowledge and insi@@ ghts .
I expla@@ ined to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck .
I had been investig@@ ating a number of issues at the inter@@ section of science and civil liber@@ ties — sup@@ er interesting .
But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to engage these issues in a much bigger way , in a way that could really make a difference .
So Chris cut right to the cha@@ se , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic dis@@ crimin@@ ation , and re@@ productive technologies , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ...
oh , there &apos;s this really cool issue , func@@ tional M@@ R@@ I and using it for lie detec@@ tion , and ...
oh , and of course , there &apos;s gene pat@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ene pat@@ ents ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , you know , pat@@ ents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the U@@ S government has been issu@@ ing pat@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three artic@@ les .
And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ st@@ ing in my office .
&quot; Oh my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we su@@ e ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Now Chris is a really brilliant law@@ yer , but he knew almost nothing about pat@@ ent law and certainly nothing about gene@@ tics .
I knew something about gene@@ tics , but I wasn &apos;t even a law@@ yer , let alone a pat@@ ent law@@ yer .
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a law@@ suit .
First , we needed to understand exactly what was pat@@ ented when someone pat@@ ented a gene .
G@@ ene pat@@ ents typic@@ ally con@@ tain do@@ z@@ ens of cl@@ aim@@ s , but the most contro@@ versi@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; isol@@ ated DNA &quot; &quot; — nam@@ ely , a piece of DNA that has been re@@ moved from a cell .
G@@ ene pat@@ ent pro@@ pon@@ ents say , &quot; &quot; See ? We didn &apos;t pat@@ ent the gene in your body , we pat@@ ented an isol@@ ated gene . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isol@@ ated .
And the pat@@ ents weren &apos;t just to a particular gene that they isol@@ ated , but on every possible version of that gene .
So what does that mean ?
That means that you can &apos;t give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mut@@ ations , without per@@ mission of the pat@@ ent hol@@ der .
It also means that the pat@@ ent hol@@ der has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing .
Al@@ lowing pat@@ ent hol@@ ders , often private companies , to lock up stre@@ t@@ ches of the human genome was har@@ ming patients .
Con@@ si@@ der A@@ big@@ ail , a 10@@ -year-old with long Q@@ T syn@@ dro@@ me , a serious heart condition that , if left un@@ treated , can result in sudden death .
The company that ob@@ tain@@ ed a pat@@ ent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diag@@ nose the syn@@ dro@@ me .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t and they never offer@@ ed it .
So another lab tried to offer the test , but the company that held the pat@@ ents thre@@ aten@@ ed to su@@ e the lab for pat@@ ent infr@@ ing@@ ement .
So as a result , for 2 years , no test was available .
Dur@@ ing that time , A@@ big@@ ail died of un@@ diagnos@@ ed long Q@@ T .
G@@ ene pat@@ ents clearly were a problem and were har@@ ming patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
Tur@@ ns out that the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made clear through a long line of cases , that certain things are not pat@@ ent eli@@ gible .
You can &apos;t pat@@ ent products of nature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , elements of the peri@@ odi@@ c table .
And you can &apos;t pat@@ ent laws of nature — the law of grav@@ ity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 .
It seemed to us that DNA , the most fundamental structure of life , that co@@ des for the production of all of our prote@@ ins , is both a product of nature and a law of nature , regar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tu@@ be .
As we del@@ ved into this issue , we travel@@ ed all over the country to speak with many different experts — scientists , medical profes@@ sion@@ als , law@@ y@@ ers , pat@@ ent law@@ y@@ ers .
Most of them agre@@ ed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
All of them thought our chan@@ ces of win@@ ning a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent challenge were about zero .
Why is that ?
Well , the pat@@ ent office had been issu@@ ing these pat@@ ents for more than 20 years .
There were literally thousands of pat@@ ents on human genes .
The pat@@ ent bar was deeply entren@@ ched in the status qu@@ o , the bi@@ otec@@ h industry had grown up around this practice , and legisl@@ ation to ban gene pat@@ ents had been introduc@@ ed year after year in Con@@ gress , and had gone absolutely no@@ where .
So the bottom line : cour@@ ts just weren &apos;t going to be willing to over@@ turn these pat@@ ents .
Now , ne@@ i@@ ther Chris n@@ or I were the type to sh@@ y away from a challenge , and hearing , &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; seemed all the more reason to take on this fight .
So we set out to build our case .
Now , pat@@ ent cases tend to be : Com@@ p@@ any A su@@ es Com@@ p@@ any B over some really n@@ arro@@ w , obs@@ cure technical issue .
We weren &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bigger than that .
This was about scientific freedom , medical progress , the rights of patients .
So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical pat@@ ent case — more like a civil rights case .
We set out to identify a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent hol@@ der that was vi@@ gor@@ ously en@@ for@@ c@@ ing its pat@@ ents and then to organiz@@ e a bro@@ ad co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s and experts that could tell the cour@@ t about all the ways that these pat@@ ents were har@@ ming patients and innovation .
We found the prime candi@@ date to su@@ e in M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad Gen@@ e@@ tics , a company that &apos;s based in Sal@@ t L@@ ake City , U@@ ta@@ h .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad held pat@@ ents on two genes , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 genes .
Women with certain mut@@ ations along these genes are considered to be at a signific@@ antly increas@@ ed risk of developing breast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had used its pat@@ ents to main@@ tain a complete mon@@ o@@ po@@ ly on B@@ R@@ CA testing in the United States .
It had forced multiple lab@@ s that were offer@@ ing B@@ R@@ CA testing to stop .
It char@@ ged a lot of money for its test — over 3,000 dollars .
It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community .
And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad re@@ f@@ used to up@@ date its test to inclu@@ de addi@@ tional mut@@ ations that had been identi@@ fied by a team of researchers in Fr@@ ance .
It has been esti@@ mat@@ ed that during that period , for several years , as many as 12 percent of women under@@ going testing received the wrong answer — a negative test result that should have been positive .
This is K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Ma@@ xi@@ an .
K@@ ath@@ le@@ en &apos;s sister E@@ i@@ le@@ en developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was test@@ ed by M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was negative .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
That meant that E@@ i@@ le@@ en &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other members of her family didn &apos;t need to be test@@ ed .
But two years later , K@@ ath@@ le@@ en was diagnos@@ ed with adv@@ anc@@ ed@@ -@@ stage o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
It turned out that K@@ ath@@ le@@ en &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who received a fal@@ se@@ -@@ negative test result .
H@@ ad E@@ i@@ le@@ en received the pro@@ per result , K@@ ath@@ le@@ en would have then been test@@ ed , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been pre@@ vent@@ ed .
Once we sett@@ led on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad , we then had to form a co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s and experts that could illu@@ min@@ ate these problems .
One of the major challenges we had in prepar@@ ing the case was figur@@ ing out how best to communicate the science .
So in order to argue that what M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did was not an inven@@ tion , and that isol@@ ated B@@ R@@ CA genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
How is DNA isol@@ ated , and why isn &apos;t that an inven@@ tion ?
We spent hours and hours with our pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s and experts , trying to come up with ways of expla@@ ining these concep@@ ts simply yet accur@@ ately .
And we ended up rel@@ ying he@@ avi@@ ly on the use of metap@@ hor@@ s , like gold .
So isol@@ ating DNA — it &apos;s like extr@@ acting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed .
You might be able to pat@@ ent the process for min@@ ing the gold , but you can &apos;t pat@@ ent the gold itself .
It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and effort to di@@ g the gold out of the mountain ; you still can &apos;t pat@@ ent it , it &apos;s still gold .
And the gold , once it &apos;s extr@@ acted , can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the mountain ; you can make je@@ wel@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t pat@@ ent the gold , it &apos;s still gold .
So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
We fil@@ ed in federal cour@@ t in the Sou@@ thern D@@ istr@@ ic@@ t of New York , and the case was ran@@ dom@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned to J@@ ud@@ ge Robert S@@ we@@ et .
In Mar@@ ch 2010 , J@@ ud@@ ge S@@ we@@ et issu@@ ed his opini@@ on — 15@@ 2 pages — and a complete vic@@ tory for our side .
In reading the opini@@ on , we could not get over how el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently he described the science in the case .
I mean , our bri@@ ef — it was pretty good , but not this good .
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
We just could not com@@ pre@@ h@@ end how this had happened .
So it turned out , J@@ ud@@ ge S@@ we@@ et &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a law@@ yer — he was a scientist .
He was not just a scientist — he had a Ph@@ D in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What an incredible str@@ o@@ ke of lu@@ ck !
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ ed@@ eral C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
First , in a pi@@ vot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government swit@@ ched sides .
So in the distr@@ ic@@ t cour@@ t the government sub@@ mit@@ ted a bri@@ ef on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
But now in direct op@@ position to its own pat@@ ent office , the U@@ S government fi@@ les a bri@@ ef that states that is has re@@ considered this issue in light of the distr@@ ic@@ t cour@@ t &apos;s opini@@ on , and has conclu@@ ded that isol@@ ated DNA is not pat@@ ent eli@@ gible .
This was a really big deal , totally un@@ expected .
The C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ ed@@ eral C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it hear@@ s all pat@@ ent cases , and it has a repu@@ tation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ pat@@ ent .
So even with this remarkable development , we expected to lose .
And we did .
Sor@@ t of .
En@@ ds up sp@@ lit decision , 2 to 1 .
But the two jud@@ ges who r@@ ul@@ ed against us , did so for completely different reasons .
The first one , J@@ ud@@ ge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own no@@ vel , biological theory — totally wrong .
( Laughter ) He decided M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had created a new chemical — made absolutely no sense .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even argue this , so it came out of the blue .
The other , J@@ ud@@ ge Mo@@ ore , said she basically agre@@ ed with us that isol@@ ated DNA is a product of nature .
But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to sha@@ ke up the bi@@ otec@@ h industry . &quot; &quot; The third , J@@ ud@@ ge Br@@ y@@ son , agre@@ ed with us .
So now we s@@ ought re@@ view by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
And when you pe@@ ti@@ tion the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to present a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to answer .
U@@ su@@ ally these questions take the form of a super@@ -@@ long par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h , like a whole page long with lots and lots of cl@@ a@@ uses , &quot; wher@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; therefore that . &quot;
We sub@@ mit@@ ted perhaps the shor@@ test question present@@ ed ever .
F@@ our words : Are human genes pat@@ ent@@ able ?
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I think you have to say , &apos; Is isol@@ ated DNA pat@@ ent@@ able ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ op@@ e .
I want the jus@@ tic@@ es to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only hear@@ s about one percent of the cases that it recei@@ ves , and it agre@@ ed to hear ours .
The day of the oral argument arri@@ ves , and it was really , really exciting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the morning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se .
Two breast cancer organizations , B@@ re@@ ast Can@@ cer Ac@@ tion and F@@ O@@ R@@ C@@ E , had organized a demonstr@@ ation on the cour@@ thou@@ se steps .
Chris and I sat qui@@ et@@ ly in the hall@@ way , moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career .
I was clearly more nervous than he was .
But any rema@@ ining p@@ anic sub@@ si@@ ded as I walked into the cour@@ tro@@ om and looked around at a sea of friend@@ ly faces : our individual women cli@@ ents who had shared their deeply personal stories , the gene@@ tici@@ sts who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their bus@@ y care@@ ers to dedic@@ ate themselves to this fight and represent@@ atives from a diver@@ se arr@@ ay of medical , patient ad@@ voc@@ acy , environmental and religious organizations , who had sub@@ mit@@ ted friend of the cour@@ t bri@@ efs in the case .
Al@@ so in the room were three leaders of the Hu@@ man Gen@@ o@@ me Pro@@ ject , including the co-@@ disco@@ ver@@ er of DNA himself , James Wat@@ son , who had sub@@ mit@@ ted a bri@@ ef to the cour@@ t , where he refer@@ red to gene pat@@ ent@@ ing as &quot; &quot; lun@@ acy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represent@@ ed in this room and the contribu@@ tions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volu@@ mes to what was at st@@ ake .
The argument itself was ri@@ v@@ eting .
Chris argu@@ ed brilli@@ antly .
But for me , the most thri@@ lling asp@@ ect was watching the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t jus@@ tic@@ es grap@@ ple with isol@@ ated DNA , through a series of col@@ or@@ ful anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es and fe@@ ist@@ y ex@@ changes , very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years .
J@@ usti@@ ce K@@ ag@@ an lik@@ en@@ ed isol@@ ating DNA to extr@@ acting a medicin@@ al plant from the Amazon .
J@@ usti@@ ce Rob@@ er@@ ts distingu@@ ished it from car@@ ving a bas@@ e@@ ball b@@ at from a tree .
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments , J@@ usti@@ ce S@@ ot@@ o@@ mayor pro@@ cl@@ aim@@ ed isol@@ ated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confid@@ ent leaving the cour@@ tro@@ om that day , but I could never have anticip@@ ated the out@@ come : nine to zero .
&quot; &quot; A natur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing DNA seg@@ ment is a product of nature , and not pat@@ ent@@ -@@ eli@@ gible mer@@ ely because it has been isol@@ ated .
And fur@@ ther@@ more , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; Wi@@ thin 24 hours of the decision , five lab@@ s had announ@@ ced that they would begin to offer testing for the B@@ R@@ CA genes .
Some of them promis@@ ed to offer the t@@ ests at a lower price than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
Some promis@@ ed to provide a more com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive test than the one M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad was offer@@ ing .
But of course the decision goes far beyond M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It ends a 25@@ -@@ year practice of allo@@ wing pat@@ ents on human genes in the United States .
It clear@@ s a significant barri@@ er to bio@@ medical discovery and innovation .
And it helps to en@@ sure that patients like A@@ big@@ ail , K@@ ath@@ le@@ en and E@@ i@@ le@@ en have access to the t@@ ests that they need .
A few weeks after the cour@@ t issu@@ ed its decision , I received a small pack@@ age in the ma@@ il .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
Par@@ t of what gave us the cour@@ age to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many tw@@ ists and turns along the way .
A little lu@@ ck certainly helped , but it was the communities that we bri@@ d@@ ged , the al@@ li@@ ances that we created , that made pi@@ gs fly .
Thank you .

The second quote is from the head of the U@@ K Fin@@ anci@@ al Ser@@ v@@ ices Au@@ th@@ ority .
Un@@ fortunately , the answer is yes .
Then , predic@@ tions can be made and test@@ ed .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
Where are economic networks ?
What we looked at in detail was ow@@ ner@@ ship networks .
And we also as@@ sign a value to the company given by the operating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organized ? Are they isol@@ ated ?
These are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3,000 .
Let me explain by giving you this analog@@ y .
H@@ i . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through gli@@ mp@@ ses of about eight of my projects , done in collabor@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish artist Sor@@ en P@@ ors .
We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my un@@ cle &apos;s p@@ ecu@@ liar hab@@ it of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an exten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes .
And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a resp@@ ected figure in the Indian family .
And the situation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fied me the most was his use of a land@@ line tel@@ eph@@ one .
He would hold on to the recei@@ ver and expect me to dial a number for him .
And so as a response and as a gift to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his com@@ man@@ ds .
And so I made him a gol@@ den ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er through which he could dis@@ pen@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ eces around the world as an email .
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carri@@ age , type his email or comm@@ and and pull the paper out .
This device would automa@@ tically send the inten@@ ded person the letter as an email .
So here you can see , we em@@ bed@@ ded a lot of electr@@ on@@ ics that underst@@ ands all of the mechan@@ ical actions and conver@@ ts it to digital .
So my un@@ cle is only dealing with a mechan@@ ical inter@@ face .
And of course , the object had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of rit@@ u@@ alism , the way my un@@ cle li@@ kes it .
The next work is a so@@ und@@ -@@ sensitive install@@ ation that we aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surro@@ unded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sensitive and swe@@ et creatures .
So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hi@@ de .
And as soon as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out .
And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out .
And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again .
So we had these pan@@ els on three walls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototy@@ pe .
So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
So they get immun@@ e to sounds that s@@ care them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to background sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( No@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( W@@ hist@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as life@@ like as possible .
So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , psy@@ che , mo@@ od sw@@ ings , person@@ alities and so on .
So this is a very early prototy@@ pe .
Of course , it got much better after that .
And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and child@@ like with them .
This is a video install@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The Mis@@ sing Per@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with playing with the notion of in@@ visi@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ visi@@ bility ?
So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in camera surve@@ ill@@ ance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , ren@@ der@@ ing them invisible .
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototy@@ pe .
On the right side you can see my colleagu@@ e Sor@@ en , who &apos;s actually in the space .
And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the proc@@ essed video where the camera has made him invisible .
Sor@@ en ent@@ ers the room . Po@@ p ! He goes invisible .
And you can see that the camera is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty soon , later .
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monit@@ or , one on each wall .
And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monit@@ or , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wher@@ ever they moved in the room .
So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Sha@@ dow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a she@@ et of paper , like a cu@@ t@@ out of a child@@ like drawing of an oil spi@@ ll or a sun .
And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and rob@@ ust , and from the side , it almost seemed very we@@ ak .
So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignor@@ e it , thinking it was some cra@@ p l@@ aying around .
But as soon as they passed by , it would start to cli@@ mb up the wall in jer@@ ky fashion .
And it would get ex@@ ha@@ usted , and it would collap@@ se every time .
( Laughter ) So this work is a caric@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fall@@ en into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
Well what he does is he moves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken fashion on his head in a very un@@ predic@@ table and extremely slow movement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ str@@ ain@@ ed by that circle .
Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to w@@ ander about in the space .
And there &apos;s no w@@ ir@@ es .
So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activ@@ ates this object .
And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it g@@ ains mo@@ ment@@ um and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an inst@@ inct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pull itself up .
So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechan@@ ics right and the equili@@ bri@@ um and the dy@@ nam@@ ics .
And it was very important for us to establi@@ sh the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ alism , or that sense of want@@ ing to go and help it .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test sc@@ enario — it &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my colleagu@@ e . He &apos;s let it go .
Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own .
So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ thetic of fu@@ r em@@ bed@@ ded with thousands of tiny different si@@ zes of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sky .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
So we wr@@ apped this around a b@@ lob@@ -@@ like form , which is in the shape of a t@@ ed@@ dy bear , which was han@@ ging from the ce@@ iling .
And the idea was to sort of contr@@ ast something very cold and dist@@ ant and abstr@@ act like the universe into the familiar form of a t@@ ed@@ dy bear , which is very comfor@@ ting and inti@@ mate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a t@@ ed@@ dy bear and you would almost percei@@ ve it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sky .
So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ pace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ached it , it tried to inti@@ mi@@ date you by growing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s twice its he@@ ight and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
And so this object is constantly exp@@ anding and contr@@ acting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a secret within its se@@ ams or something .
So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to expres@@ s the emotions and behavi@@ oral patterns in these creatures that we create .
And once a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this cre@@ ature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
Thank you .

OK , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
And specifically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love .
Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this metaphor , fall@@ ing , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I concep@@ tu@@ alize this metaphor , what I picture is straight out of a carto@@ on — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s walking down the si@@ de@@ walk , without realiz@@ ing it , he cros@@ ses over an open man@@ hole , and he just plu@@ m@@ me@@ ts into the se@@ wer below .
And I picture it this way because fall@@ ing is not ju@@ mp@@ ing .
F@@ all@@ ing is accid@@ ental , it &apos;s un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our con@@ sent .
And this — this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship .
I am a writ@@ er and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which means I think about words for a living .
You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters , and I would like to argue that many of the metap@@ hor@@ s we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem .
So , in love , we fall .
We &apos;re struc@@ k .
We are cr@@ ush@@ ed .
We sw@@ o@@ on .
We bur@@ n with passion .
Lo@@ ve makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
Our hear@@ ts ac@@ he , and then they break .
So our metap@@ hor@@ s equ@@ ate the experience of lo@@ ving someone to extreme violence or ill@@ ness .
( Laughter ) They do .
And they position us as the victims of un@@ for@@ es@@ een and totally un@@ avo@@ id@@ able circum@@ st@@ ances .
My favorite one of these is &quot; &quot; s@@ mit@@ ten , &quot; &quot; which is the past partici@@ ple of the word &quot; &quot; s@@ mite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dic@@ tionary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defined as both &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I tend to associ@@ ate the word &quot; &quot; s@@ mite &quot; &quot; with a very particular context , which is the O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
In the Bo@@ ok of Ex@@ o@@ du@@ s alone , there are 16 refer@@ ences to s@@ mit@@ ing , which is the word that the Bi@@ ble uses for the ven@@ ge@@ ance of an an@@ gry God .
( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a pla@@ gue of lo@@ cu@@ sts . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So , how did this happen ?
How have we come to associ@@ ate love with great pain and suffering ?
And why do we talk about this o@@ sten@@ sibly good experience as if we are victims ?
These are difficult questions , but I have some the@@ ories .
And to think this through , I want to focus on one metaphor in particular , which is the idea of love as mad@@ ness .
When I first started resear@@ ching ro@@ man@@ tic love , I found these mad@@ ness metap@@ hor@@ s everywhere .
The history of Western culture is full of language that equ@@ ates love to mental ill@@ ness .
These are just a few examples .
Willi@@ am Sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are : &quot; Lo@@ ve is mer@@ ely a mad@@ ness , &quot; from &quot; &quot; As You Like It . &quot; &quot; Fri@@ ed@@ rich Ni@@ et@@ z@@ s@@ che : &quot; There is always some mad@@ ness in love . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ t me looking , got me looking so crazy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great philosoph@@ er , B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é K@@ now@@ les . ( Laughter )
I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty tur@@ bul@@ ent relationship right from the start .
And it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high high@@ s and very low lo@@ ws .
I can remember one moment in particular .
I was sitting on a bed in a ho@@ st@@ el in South America , and I was watching the person I love walk out the door .
And it was late , it was nearly mid@@ night , we &apos;d gotten into an argument over dinner , and when we got back to our room , he thre@@ w his things in the ba@@ g and stor@@ med out .
Whi@@ le I can no longer remember what that argument was about , I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave .
I was 22 , it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
I had another week until my flight home , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around .
I had no gu@@ ide@@ book and very little money , and I spoke no S@@ pan@@ ish .
Some@@ one more ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just fro@@ ze .
I just sat there .
And then I bur@@ st into t@@ ears .
But despite my p@@ anic , some small voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dram@@ atic .
I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel miser@@ able in love .
And it sounds so strange to me now , but at 22 , I lon@@ ged to have dram@@ atic experiences , and in that moment , I was ir@@ rational and f@@ uri@@ ous and devast@@ ated , and we@@ ir@@ dly enough , I thought that this somehow le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me .
I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how loved worked .
This really should not be surprising , consider@@ ing that ac@@ cording to Wikipedia , there are eight fil@@ ms , 14 son@@ gs , two al@@ bu@@ ms and one no@@ vel with the ti@@ tle &quot; &quot; C@@ raz@@ y Lo@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Ab@@ out half an hour later , he came back to our room .
We made up .
We spent another mostly happy week travel@@ ing together .
And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terrible and so great .
This must be a real ro@@ mance . &quot; &quot; I expected my first love to feel like mad@@ ness , and of course , it met that expect@@ ation very well .
But lo@@ ving someone like that — as if my entire well-@@ being depen@@ ded on him lo@@ ving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
But I sus@@ p@@ ect this experience of love is not that un@@ usual .
Most of us do feel a bit ma@@ d in the early st@@ ages of ro@@ man@@ tic love .
In fact , there is research to confir@@ m that this is some@@ what normal , because , neuro@@ chem@@ ically speaking , ro@@ man@@ tic love and mental ill@@ ness are not that easily distingu@@ ished .
This is true .
This study from 199@@ 9 used blood t@@ ests to confir@@ m that the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in levels of the new@@ ly in love very clo@@ sely res@@ em@@ bled the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in levels of people who had been diagnos@@ ed with obs@@ es@@ si@@ ve-@@ compu@@ l@@ sive dis@@ order .
( Laughter ) Yes , and low levels of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in are also associated with se@@ as@@ onal aff@@ ective dis@@ order and depression .
So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our mo@@ ods and our behavi@@ ors .
And there are other studies to confir@@ m that most relationships begin this way .
Res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers believe that the low levels of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in is cor@@ related with obs@@ es@@ sive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up cam@@ p in your brain .
And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usually from a few months to a couple of years .
When I got back from my trip to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , chec@@ king my email , desper@@ ate to hear from the guy I loved .
I decided that if my friends could not understand my gri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , then I did not need their friend@@ ship .
So I stopped han@@ ging out with most of them .
And it was probably the most un@@ happy year of my life .
But I think I felt like it was my job to be miser@@ able , because if I could be miser@@ able , then I would prove how much I loved him .
And if I could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
Our biology tells us that love is good by activ@@ ating these re@@ ward circu@@ its in our brain , and it tells us that love is pain@@ ful when , after a fight or a break@@ up , that neuro@@ chemical re@@ ward is with@@ dra@@ wn .
And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neuro@@ chem@@ ically speaking , going through a break@@ up is a lot like going through co@@ ca@@ ine with@@ dra@@ w@@ al , which I find reas@@ sur@@ ing .
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and re@@ infor@@ ce these ideas about love .
In this case , we &apos;re talking about metap@@ hor@@ s about pain and ad@@ dic@@ tion and mad@@ ness .
It &apos;s kind of an interesting feedback loo@@ p .
Lo@@ ve is powerful and at times pain@@ ful , and we expres@@ s this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and pain@@ ful .
What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values li@@ fel@@ ong mon@@ og@@ am@@ y .
It seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like mad@@ ness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
That sounds terrible .
( Laughter ) To re@@ conci@@ le this , we need to either change our culture or change our expect@@ ations .
So , imagine if we were all less pas@@ sive in love .
If we were more as@@ ser@@ tive , more open@@ -@@ min@@ ded , more gener@@ ous and instead of fall@@ ing in love , we st@@ ep@@ ped into love .
I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
They argue that metap@@ hor@@ s really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a gui@@ de for future actions , like self-@@ ful@@ fi@@ lling pro@@ p@@ he@@ ci@@ es .
John@@ son and L@@ ak@@ off suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collabor@@ ative work of art .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
Lin@@ gui@@ sts talk about metap@@ hor@@ s as having ent@@ ail@@ ments , which is essentially a way of consider@@ ing all the implic@@ ations of , or ideas con@@ tain@@ ed within , a given metaphor .
And John@@ son and L@@ ak@@ off talk about everything that collabor@@ ating on a work of art ent@@ ails : effort , compromi@@ se , pati@@ ence , shared go@@ als .
These ideas ali@@ g@@ n n@@ ic@@ ely with our cultural investment in long-@@ term ro@@ man@@ tic commit@@ ment , but they also work well for other kinds of relationships — shor@@ t-@@ term , cas@@ ual , pol@@ y@@ amor@@ ous , non-@@ mon@@ og@@ am@@ ous , as@@ ex@@ ual — because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of lo@@ ving someone .
So if love is a collabor@@ ative work of art , then love is an a@@ es@@ thetic experience .
Lo@@ ve is un@@ predic@@ table , love is creative , love requires communication and discipl@@ ine , it is fr@@ us@@ trat@@ ing and emo@@ tionally dem@@ anding .
And love invol@@ ves both joy and pain .
U@@ lti@@ mately , each experience of love is different .
When I was youn@@ ger , it never occur@@ red to me that I was allowed to demand more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accept whatever love offer@@ ed .
When 14@@ -year-old Ju@@ li@@ et first me@@ ets — or , when 14@@ -year-old Ju@@ li@@ et cannot be with Ro@@ me@@ o , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel dis@@ ap@@ pointed or ang@@ st@@ y .
Where is she ?
She wants to die .
Right ?
And just as a re@@ fres@@ her , at this point in the play , act three of five , Ro@@ me@@ o is not dead .
He &apos;s alive , he &apos;s healthy , he &apos;s just been ban@@ ished from the city .
I understand that 16@@ th-@@ century Ver@@ ona is un@@ like contempor@@ ary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Ju@@ li@@ et &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
Re@@ fr@@ aming love as something I get to create with someone I admi@@ re , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or con@@ sent , is em@@ power@@ ing .
It &apos;s still hard .
Lo@@ ve still feels totally mad@@ den@@ ing and cr@@ ush@@ ing some days , and when I feel really frustr@@ ated , I have to re@@ mind myself : my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together .
This isn &apos;t easy , either .
But it &apos;s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like mad@@ ness .
This version of love is not about win@@ ning or losing someone &apos;s aff@@ ection .
Instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when tr@@ ust@@ ing feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolu@@ tionary , radical act .
This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re g@@ ain@@ ing or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good collabor@@ ators . Maybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shor@@ ter than I had plan@@ ned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collabor@@ ative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculp@@ t itself .
This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really gl@@ ad to be here .
I &apos;m gl@@ ad you &apos;re here , because that would be a little weird .
I &apos;m gl@@ ad we &apos;re all here .
And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
But here .
I mean Earth .
And by &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in this audi@@ tori@@ um , but life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to sing@@ le-@@ cel@@ led , from mo@@ ld to mus@@ h@@ rooms to flying be@@ ars . ( Laughter )
Is Earth special ?
This is a question I &apos;ve wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child , and I sus@@ p@@ ect 80 percent of this audi@@ tori@@ um has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer .
To understand whether there are any planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that can support life , the first step is to understand what life here requires .
It turns out , of all of those 8@@ .@@ 7 million species , life only needs three things .
On one side , all life on Earth needs energy .
There are a number of different energy sources available on all planets .
On the other side , all life needs food or n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment .
And this seems like a t@@ all order , especially if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent to@@ ma@@ to .
And not fro@@ zen water , and not water in a g@@ ase@@ ous state , but li@@ quid water .
And many solar system bodies don &apos;t have li@@ quid water , and so we don &apos;t look there .
So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
Let &apos;s think only about li@@ quid water on the surface of a planet .
You want to have an atmosphere for water to be li@@ quid .
You have to be very care@@ ful with that atmosphere .
But if you have too little atmosphere and it &apos;s too thin and too cold , you end up like Mars , too cold .
Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
When Gol@@ di@@ loc@@ ks wal@@ ks into the room determin@@ es the answer that we get in the story .
And the same is true with planets .
They &apos;re not st@@ atic things . They change .
They v@@ ary . They evol@@ ve .
And atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ es do the same .
This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed , and it changed in big ways .
Where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be li@@ quid at the surface ?
Well , one idea is it escap@@ ed away to space .
And this happens with all bodies with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ es .
But Ven@@ us also has an atmosphere that escap@@ es with time , and Mars and Earth as well .
It &apos;s just a matter of degree and a matter of scale .
Nu@@ mber one , sun@@ light .
Li@@ ght em@@ it@@ ted from the sun can be absor@@ bed by atmo@@ sp@@ heri@@ c particles and warm the particles .
Yes , I &apos;m d@@ ancing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even at my w@@ ed@@ ding . ( Laughter )
I mentioned that there were two things about the Gol@@ di@@ loc@@ ks story that I wanted to bring to your attention and re@@ mind you about , and the second one is a little bit more sub@@ tle .
If P@@ ap@@ a B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too hot , and M@@ ama B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too cold , shouldn &apos;t Bab@@ y B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l be even col@@ der if we &apos;re following the tr@@ end ?
This thing that you &apos;ve accep@@ ted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple .
And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determin@@ es its temperature .
This has to play into habit@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
Earth has one ; Ven@@ us and Mars do not .
I like to think of it instead as a sal@@ ad bar s@@ ne@@ e@@ ze gu@@ ard for planets .
At@@ mo@@ sphere hasn &apos;t been able to escape .
Mars , on the other hand , has been un@@ prot@@ ected because of its lack of magnetic field , and over billions of years , maybe enough atmosphere has been stri@@ pped away to account for a transi@@ tion from a habit@@ able planet to the planet that we see today .
O@@ ther scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sa@@ ils on a ship , en@@ ab@@ ling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself .
It &apos;s an idea that has to be test@@ ed , but the effect and how it works seems appar@@ ent .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
Well , we &apos;ve sent spac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to all three planets .
It &apos;s designed to measure atmo@@ sp@@ heri@@ c escape .
We have similar measu@@ re@@ ments from Ven@@ us and Earth .
Once we have that answer , why should you care ?
And financi@@ ally as well , but deeply .
It will teach us about atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ es that surro@@ und us and that are close .
An@@ y le@@ ver will help .
In fact , based on observ@@ ations that Ke@@ pl@@ er &apos;s taken and other similar observ@@ ations , we now believe that , of the 200 billion stars in the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay galaxy alone , on average , every star has at least one planet .
It &apos;s a little bit like being tr@@ apped on a red spot — ( Laughter ) on a stage and knowing that there are other worl@@ ds out there and desper@@ ately want@@ ing to know more about them , want@@ ing to inter@@ ro@@ gate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you .
In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habit@@ able , although very soon we may come to know of more .
But for now , this is the only habit@@ able planet , and this is our red spot .
I &apos;m really gl@@ ad we &apos;re here .
Thanks .
( Applause )
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Think about everything it has brought us .
Think about all the services we use , all the connec@@ tivity , all the enter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the commer@@ ce .
And it &apos;s happening during our life@@ times .
I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remem@@ ber@@ ed as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Bra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ p@@ py dis@@ k — five and a quar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ p@@ py dis@@ k inf@@ ected by Bra@@ in@@ .@@ A.
It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for P@@ C computers .
And we actually know where Bra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
That &apos;s the bo@@ ot sector of an inf@@ ected flo@@ p@@ py , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ geon . &quot; &quot; And then it continu@@ es , saying , 198@@ 6 , B@@ asi@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad .
And B@@ asi@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad are first names , Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ i first names .
In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pak@@ istan .
( Laughter ) Now , 198@@ 6 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C virus problem is 25 years old now .
So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pak@@ istan myself .
So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pak@@ istan .
This is from the city of L@@ ahor@@ e , which is around 300 kilometers south from Ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was caught .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am block at A@@ llama I@@ q@@ b@@ al To@@ wn .
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the door .
( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
B@@ asi@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is B@@ asi@@ t .
S@@ itting down is his brother Am@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wrote the first P@@ C virus .
Now of course , we had a very interesting discus@@ sion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of satisfac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ asi@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad had had their computers inf@@ ected do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ related other viruses over these years .
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 198@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obviously are not a problem any more .
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m running here is a system that en@@ ables me to run ag@@ e-@@ old programs on a modern computer .
So let me just moun@@ t some dri@@ ves . Go over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de virus first .
And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ lling across your computer when you get inf@@ ected by this one .
You know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected because it actually shows up .
Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called C@@ r@@ ash , invented in Rus@@ sia in 199@@ 2 .
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
( S@@ ir@@ en noise ) And the last example , guess what the Wal@@ ker virus does ?
Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get inf@@ ected .
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected by a virus , when the viruses were written by ho@@ b@@ b@@ y@@ ists and teen@@ agers .
Today , they are no longer being written by ho@@ b@@ b@@ y@@ ists and teen@@ agers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our lab@@ s , where we track virus infec@@ tions world@@ wide .
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just bloc@@ ked viruses in Sw@@ eden and T@@ ai@@ w@@ an and Rus@@ sia and el@@ se@@ where .
In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of mal@@ w@@ are we find every single day .
Here &apos;s the lat@@ est virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Ser@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ .
And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previ@@ ous one , six seconds ago .
And if we just sc@@ roll around , it &apos;s just massive .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gan@@ gs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
It &apos;s gan@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ st@@ a@@ Bu@@ ck@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a website operating in M@@ os@@ co@@ w where these guys are bu@@ ying inf@@ ected computers .
So if you are a virus writ@@ er and you &apos;re capable of inf@@ ecting W@@ in@@ dows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those inf@@ ected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
So how do these guys then mon@@ eti@@ ze those inf@@ ected computers ?
Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your online ban@@ king accoun@@ ts when you do online ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ log@@ gers .
K@@ ey@@ log@@ gers sil@@ ently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google search@@ es .
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the crimin@@ als .
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the crimin@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single pass@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are ses@@ sions where you go online and do online pur@@ cha@@ ses in any online store .
Because when you do pur@@ cha@@ ses in online st@@ ores , you will be ty@@ ping in your name , the deli@@ very address , your credit card number and the credit card security co@@ des .
And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of weeks ago .
That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pir@@ ation date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the card .
Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
And that , obviously , is a problem .
We now have a whole under@@ ground mark@@ et@@ place and business ecos@@ y@@ stem built around online crime .
One example of how these guys actually are capable of mon@@ e@@ tiz@@ ing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the pages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and search for wanted person@@ s .
We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ di@@ n , origin@@ ally from Sw@@ eden , and his partner in crime , also list@@ ed on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted pages , Mr. Sha@@ il@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ u@@ mar J@@ ain , a U.S. citiz@@ en .
These guys were running an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U. , a cy@@ ber@@ crime oper@@ ation through which they ne@@ tt@@ ed millions .
They are both right now on the run .
No@@ body knows where they are .
U.S. of@@ fici@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , fro@@ ze a S@@ wis@@ s bank account bel@@ on@@ ging to Mr. J@@ ain , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it .
So the amount of money online crime gener@@ ates is significant .
And that means that the online crimin@@ als can actually afford to invest into their att@@ acks .
We know that online crimin@@ als are hi@@ ring program@@ mers , hi@@ ring testing people , testing their code , having back@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L dat@@ ab@@ ases .
And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security prec@@ au@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Cl@@ ari@@ fied N@@ et@@ works , which ill@@ us@@ trat@@ es how one single mal@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world .
This oper@@ ation , believed to be origin@@ ally from Est@@ onia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shu@@ t down .
So you just can &apos;t shu@@ t these guys down .
They will switch from one country to another , from one jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally police oper@@ ations like this .
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tic@@ k@@ ets to all the online crimin@@ als of the world .
Now , crimin@@ als who weren &apos;t capable of re@@ aching us before can reach us .
So how do you actually go around finding online crimin@@ als ?
How do you actually track them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one explo@@ it file .
Here , I &apos;m looking at the He@@ x du@@ mp of an image file , which con@@ tains an explo@@ it .
And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your W@@ in@@ dows computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s code .
Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image head@@ er , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
And that code has been en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t it .
It has been en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R function 9@@ 7 .
You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting it .
Well the yellow part of the code is now dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ted .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .com / d / i@@ o@@ o@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to down@@ load and run that program .
And that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
But even more interest@@ ingly , if we continue dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this myst@@ eri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
That code is there underneath the en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
So obviously I Go@@ o@@ gl@@ ed for it .
I got zero h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
And we have a couple of Rus@@ sian guys in our lab@@ s , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like Rus@@ sia .
And 7@@ 8 is the city code for the city of St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car lic@@ ense pl@@ ates and stuff like that .
So I went looking for cont@@ acts in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
Here &apos;s this Rus@@ sian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who run@@ s his own website , and he run@@ s a blog under the popular Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ n@@ al .
And on this blog , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend .
And he dri@@ ves a very nice car .
In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ Ben@@ z S@@ 600 V@@ 12 with a six@@ -@@ li@@ ter engine with more than 400 hor@@ se@@ power .
Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year-old kid in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he b@@ log@@ ged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
In down@@ town St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually cr@@ ash@@ ed his car into another car .
And he put b@@ log@@ ged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ c@@ edes — right here is the L@@ ada S@@ am@@ ara he cr@@ ash@@ ed into .
And you can actually see that the lic@@ ense pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ara ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ c@@ edes is O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
Now I &apos;m not a law@@ yer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online crimin@@ als are caught ?
Well in most cases it never gets this far .
The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the att@@ acks are coming from .
And even if we are able to find online crimin@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come .
The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rapi@@ d pace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what Stu@@ x@@ net did is that it inf@@ ected these .
That &apos;s a Si@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7@@ -@@ 400 P@@ L@@ C , program@@ m@@ able logic &#91; contro@@ ll@@ er &#93; .
And this is what run@@ s our infrastructure .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ xes which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ board , which are program@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job .
For example , the elev@@ ators in this building most likely are contro@@ lled by one of these .
And when Stu@@ x@@ net inf@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
Because everything around us is being run by these .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
Everything is being run by computers .
Everything is reli@@ ant on these computers working .
We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of continu@@ ing to work even if computers fail .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So prepar@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gr@@ ant@@ ed aren &apos;t there .
It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continu@@ ity , thinking about back@@ u@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter .
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Think about all the services we have online .
Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
On@@ line crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defen@@ ding the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now .
What we need is more global , international law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement work to find online criminal gan@@ gs — these organized gan@@ gs that are making millions out of their att@@ acks .
That &apos;s much more important than running anti-@@ viruses or running fi@@ re@@ walls .
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these att@@ acks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
If you look at the char@@ t at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proj@@ ec@@ tions suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
And if you look at the char@@ t for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s proj@@ ected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
And we should bear in mind here that these proj@@ ec@@ tions were dra@@ wn up before the Western financial crisis .
A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the lat@@ est proj@@ ection by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ bas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proj@@ ected 20@@ 27 .
The post-@@ crisis proj@@ ection is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a decade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental resp@@ ects .
First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.@@ 3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
N@@ ever before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
Secon@@ dly , for the first time in the modern era , the domin@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civiliz@@ ational ro@@ ots .
Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad assu@@ mption in the West that as countries moder@@ ni@@ ze , they also w@@ ester@@ ni@@ ze .
This is an illu@@ sion .
It &apos;s an assu@@ mption that moder@@ n@@ ity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
It is not . It is also shap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
It will re@@ main in very fundamental resp@@ ects very different .
Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
How do we try to understand what China is ?
And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conv@@ enti@@ onal approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
We can &apos;t .
Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
The first is this : that China is not really a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
Okay , it &apos;s called itself a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
This was what China looked like with the vic@@ tory of the Q@@ in D@@ yn@@ ast@@ y in 2@@ 21 B@@ .C. at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ state period — the birth of modern China .
And you can see it against the bo@@ und@@ aries of modern China .
Or immediately after@@ ward , the Han D@@ yn@@ ast@@ y , still 2,000 years ago .
And you can see already it occu@@ pies most of what we now know as E@@ aster@@ n China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cust@@ oms like anc@@ estr@@ al wor@@ ship , of a very dist@@ inc@@ tive notion of the state , li@@ ke@@ wise , a very dist@@ inc@@ tive notion of the family , social relationships like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an values and so on .
These are all things that come from the period of the civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
In other words , China , un@@ like the Western states and most countries in the world , is shap@@ ed by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than as a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , dem@@ ograph@@ ically and ge@@ ograph@@ ically , with a population of 1.@@ 3 billion people .
What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diver@@ se and very pl@@ ur@@ al@@ istic , and in many ways very dec@@ entr@@ alized .
You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case .
It &apos;s never been the case .
So this is China , a civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
And what does it mean ?
Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implic@@ ations .
I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the ma@@ inten@@ ance of Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : break@@ down — the frag@@ ment@@ ation of the Ho@@ ly R@@ om@@ an Em@@ pi@@ re .
It divi@@ ded , and it &apos;s rema@@ ined divi@@ ded ever since .
China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very pain@@ fully holding this huge civilization , civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , together .
The second is maybe more pro@@ s@@ ai@@ c , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong .
Do you remember the han@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by Britain to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Chinese constitu@@ tional pro@@ position was .
One country , two systems .
And I &apos;ll lay a w@@ ager that bar@@ ely anyone in the West believed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ dow dres@@ sing .
When China gets its hands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the political and legal system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 .
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
We were wrong because we thought , natur@@ ally enough , in n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ways .
Think of Ger@@ man uni@@ fication , 199@@ 0 .
What happened ?
Well , basically the East was s@@ wal@@ lowed by the West .
One nation , one system .
That is the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ment@@ ality .
But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
So actually the response of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of T@@ ai@@ w@@ an — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
The Chinese have a very , very different concep@@ tion of race to most other countries .
Do you know , of the 1.@@ 3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they bel@@ ong to the same race , the Han ?
Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most popul@@ ous countries .
India , the United States , In@@ don@@ esia , Brazil — all of them are multi@@ raci@@ al .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multi@@ raci@@ al really at the mar@@ gin@@ s .
So the question is , why ?
Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , occu@@ p@@ ation , absor@@ p@@ tion , as@@ simi@@ l@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerg@@ ed — of course , nur@@ tured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
Now the great advantage of this histor@@ ical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
The Han identity has been the c@@ ement which has held this country together .
The great dis@@ advantage of it is that the Han have a very we@@ ak concep@@ tion of cultural difference .
They really believe in their own super@@ i@@ ority , and they are dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful of those who are not .
H@@ ence their at@@ titude , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs and to the Ti@@ be@@ t@@ ans .
Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
Now we in the West over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly seem to think — in these days at least — that the auth@@ ority and le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ acy of the state is a function of democracy .
The problem with this pro@@ position is that the Chinese state enjo@@ ys more le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ acy and more auth@@ ority am@@ ong@@ st the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
And the reason for this is , fir@@ stly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjo@@ ys a very special signific@@ ance as the represent@@ ative , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the guar@@ di@@ an of Chinese civilization , of the civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spir@@ itual role .
And the second reason is because , wher@@ eas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continu@@ ously challen@@ ged — I mean in the European tradition , histor@@ ically against the ch@@ urch , against other s@@ ect@@ ors of the ari@@ st@@ ocr@@ acy , against mer@@ ch@@ ants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challen@@ ged .
It &apos;s had no serious ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been construc@@ ted in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
Wh@@ er@@ eas we tend to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a str@@ anger , certainly an or@@ gan whose po@@ wers need to be limited or defined and con@@ str@@ ain@@ ed , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
The Chinese view the state as an inti@@ mate — not just as an inti@@ mate actually , as a mem@@ ber of the family — not just in fact as a mem@@ ber of the family , but as the head of the family , the pa@@ tri@@ arch of the family .
This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
It &apos;s em@@ bed@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradig@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
K@@ now that China believ@@ es in the market and the state .
I mean , A@@ dam S@@ mit@@ h , already writing in the late 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophistic@@ ated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Ma@@ o period , that has rema@@ ined more or less the case ever since .
But this is comb@@ ined with an extremely strong and u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous state .
The state is everywhere in China .
I mean , it &apos;s leading fir@@ ms — many of them are still public@@ ly ow@@ ned .
Pri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , however large they are , like L@@ eno@@ vo , depen@@ d in many ways on state patr@@ on@@ age .
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
And the state , of course , its auth@@ ority flo@@ ws into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-@@ child policy .
Mo@@ re@@ over , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of stat@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft .
I mean , if you want an ill@@ ustr@@ ation of this , the Great Wall is one .
But this is another , this is the Gr@@ and Can@@ al , which was construc@@ ted in the first instance in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .C.
and was finally complet@@ ed in the se@@ vent@@ h century A@@ .@@ D.
It went for 1,@@ 1@@ 14 miles , lin@@ king B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing with H@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou and S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastruc@@ tural projects in China , which I sup@@ pose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three G@@ or@@ ges D@@ am and many other expres@@ sions of state competen@@ ce within China .
So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civiliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
And yet we still insi@@ st , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concep@@ ts .
If you want to know why we un@@ err@@ ingly seem to get China wrong — our predic@@ tions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ correc@@ t — this is the reason .
Un@@ fortunately , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ titude towards China is that of a kind of little W@@ ester@@ ner ment@@ ality .
It &apos;s kind of arro@@ g@@ ant .
It &apos;s arro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
And secon@@ dly , it &apos;s ignor@@ ant .
We refu@@ se to really address the issue of difference .
You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pass@@ age in a book by Paul Co@@ h@@ en , the American histori@@ an .
And Paul Co@@ h@@ en argu@@ es that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cos@@ mo@@ poli@@ tan of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , it &apos;s the most par@@ o@@ chi@@ al , because for 200 years , the West has been so domin@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other civiliz@@ ations .
Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
Wh@@ er@@ eas those cul@@ tures — vir@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ aker position , vis@@ -@@ a-@@ v@@ is the West — have been there@@ by forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s pres@@ ence in those societies .
And therefore , they are , as a result , more cos@@ mo@@ poli@@ tan in many ways than the West .
I mean , take the question of East Asia .
East Asia : Japan , Kore@@ a , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Now the largest economic region in the world .
And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from East Asia , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the West than the West is about East Asia .
Now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that char@@ t at the beginning , the Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s char@@ t .
What is happening is that , very rapi@@ dly in histor@@ ical terms , the world is being driven and shap@@ ed , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 us@@ ur@@ ping very rapi@@ dly the position of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 .
And there are two consequences of this .
First , the West is rapi@@ dly losing its influence in the world .
There was a dram@@ atic ill@@ ustr@@ ation of this actually a year ago — Co@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen , climate change conference .
Europe was not at the final negoti@@ ating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
And the second implic@@ ation is that the world will inevit@@ ably , as a consequ@@ ence , become increasingly un@@ familiar to us , because it &apos;ll be shap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experiences and histori@@ es that we are not really familiar with , or convers@@ ant with .
And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ignor@@ ant , are un@@ aware about the way the world is changing .
Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sle@@ ep@@ walking into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exag@@ ger@@ ation .
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
I mean , Europe once , of course , once com@@ man@@ ded the future in its confid@@ ence .
Take the 19@@ th century , for example .
But this , al@@ as , is no longer true .
If you want to feel the future , if you want to tas@@ te the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us .
This is a ra@@ il@@ way station the li@@ kes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way station .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ han &#93; ra@@ il@@ way station for the high-@@ speed tra@@ ins .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shor@@ tly in a sub@@ ur@@ b of B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing .
Here you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the up@@ per dec@@ k carri@@ es about 2,000 people .
It trav@@ els on ra@@ ils down a sub@@ urban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
And it does spe@@ eds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
Well , what should our at@@ titude be towards this world that we see very rapi@@ dly developing before us ?
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
But I want to argue , above all , a big@@ -@@ picture positive for this world .
For 200 years , the world was essentially go@@ ver@@ ned by a frag@@ ment of the human population .
That &apos;s what Europe and North America represent@@ ed .
The arri@@ val of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ don@@ esia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democr@@ ati@@ z@@ ation in the last 200 years .
Ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no voice , which were not listen@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of represent@@ ation in this world .
As human@@ ists , we must wel@@ come , su@@ rely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civiliz@@ ations .
This big ship here was the one sa@@ iled in by Z@@ h@@ en@@ g He in the early 15@@ th century on his great vo@@ y@@ ages around the South China Se@@ a , the East China Se@@ a and across the Indian Oc@@ ean to East Africa .
The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Chri@@ stop@@ her C@@ olu@@ m@@ bus cros@@ sed the At@@ lan@@ tic .
( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this sil@@ k sc@@ roll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Chri@@ st , the Chinese even invented golf .
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
By revolution , I mean a dr@@ astic and far@@ -@@ re@@ aching change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have .
Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and ti@@ red of things not working .
You know , I &apos;m sick and ti@@ red of us not living up to our potential .
I &apos;m sick and ti@@ red of us being last .
And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors .
We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-@@ being .
And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ cono@@ mi@@ st .
We &apos;re the s@@ ad@@ dest place on Earth , rel@@ ative to GDP per cap@@ ita — the s@@ ad@@ dest place on Earth .
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Where do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another report by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
Last in reading , math and science . Last .
Bus@@ iness : The low@@ est percep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U.
that entreprene@@ urs provide benefits to society .
Why as a result , what happens ?
The low@@ est perc@@ ent@@ age of entreprene@@ urs starting businesses .
And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economi@@ es .
We hi@@ re the most people ; we create the most ta@@ xes .
So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
Last in Europe GDP per cap@@ ita .
Last .
So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of Bu@@ l@@ g@@ ari@@ ans are not optimis@@ tic about the future .
We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
And these are facts , guys .
This isn &apos;t story tal@@ e ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ spir@@ acy I have got against Bu@@ l@@ g@@ aria . These are facts .
So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our operating system of be@@ having is broken .
We need a dr@@ astic change in the way we think and be@@ have to transform Bu@@ l@@ g@@ aria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ astic to some of you — because we are han@@ di@@ cap@@ ping ourselves .
We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like .
B@@ abies play , kids play , adults play .
We don &apos;t value play .
In fact , we de@@ value play .
And we de@@ value it in three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
So@@ cial : 45 years of what ?
Of commun@@ ism — of valu@@ ing the society and the state over the individual and squ@@ ash@@ ing , in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently , creativity , individual self-@@ expres@@ sion and innovation .
And instead , what do we value ?
Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institu@@ tional context , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?
To be serious .
To be really , really serious .
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e serious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been s@@ col@@ ded in the park for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
He@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d they play in the dir@@ t , the k@@ al , or even worse , lo@@ k@@ vi , water — that will kill them .
I have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ ados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seri@@ ousness of life .
We have a serious mem@@ e running through .
It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
It &apos;s a serious gene .
It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; b@@ aba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
Ste@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . I@@ sk@@ am baby . &quot; &quot; Ste@@ p two : we get the baby . W@@ o@@ o@@ ho@@ o !
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have cof@@ fe@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give beb@@ k@@ o to b@@ aba .
But we need to remember that b@@ aba &apos;s been inf@@ ected by the serious mem@@ e for 45 years .
So what happens ?
She pas@@ ses that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the red@@ wood trees — for that serious mem@@ e to get out of our operating system .
What happens then ?
It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values r@@ ote learning , mem@@ oriz@@ ation and stand@@ ar@@ diz@@ ation , and de@@ values self-@@ expres@@ sion , self-@@ explor@@ ation , questi@@ oning , creativity and play .
It &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
We went to this pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and rec@@ ess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the sch@@ ed@@ u@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating min@@ d@@ less , robo@@ tic workers to put bol@@ ts in pre-@@ dri@@ lled holes .
But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ dus@@ trial R@@ evolution .
We need adap@@ t@@ ability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innov@@ ative .
We don &apos;t need mechan@@ ized workers .
But no , now our mem@@ e goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
We create robo@@ tic workers that we treat like as@@ sets , to le@@ ver and just throw away .
What are qu@@ alities of a Bu@@ l@@ g@@ arian work ?
Au@@ to@@ cr@@ atic — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the bos@@ s and I know better than you .
Un@@ tr@@ ust@@ ing — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to inst@@ all cameras .
( Laughter ) Con@@ tro@@ lling — you &apos;re obviously an idi@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ illi@@ on little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
So they &apos;re restric@@ tive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ .
That &apos;s somehow un@@ professional and bad .
And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ fi@@ lling because you &apos;re contro@@ lled , you &apos;re restric@@ ted , you &apos;re not valu@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fun .
In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , Steve . What a du@@ mb idea .
It can &apos;t be because of play .
Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious mem@@ e in us .
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the cat@@ al@@ y@@ st , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bu@@ l@@ g@@ aria for the better .
P@@ lay : our brains are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
E@@ volu@@ tion has sel@@ ected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
And you know what ?
E@@ volu@@ tion does a really , really good job of des@@ el@@ ecting tra@@ its that aren &apos;t advant@@ ag@@ e@@ ous to us and sel@@ ecting tra@@ its for competi@@ tive advantage .
N@@ ature isn &apos;t stupid , and it sel@@ ected for play .
Th@@ rough@@ out the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , for example : ants . An@@ ts play .
Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dy@@ nam@@ ics of things .
R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that r@@ ats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tas@@ ks better , skills .
K@@ it@@ tens play . We all know k@@ it@@ tens play .
But what you may not know is that k@@ it@@ tens de@@ pri@@ ved of play are un@@ able to interact soci@@ ally .
They can still hun@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social .
B@@ ears play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more survive longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a cor@@ rel@@ ation between play and brain size .
The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest play@@ ers ?
Y@@ ours truly : humans .
Ki@@ ds play , we play — of every n@@ ation@@ ality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
Re@@ ally cool term : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le tra@@ its in adults .
And who are the biggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
Hu@@ man@@ s . We play s@@ ports .
We do it for fun , or as O@@ ly@@ mpi@@ ans , or as profes@@ sion@@ als .
We play musical instru@@ ments .
We dance , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around .
We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
We &apos;re designed to do that continu@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
It is a huge benefit .
Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimul@@ ate neur@@ al growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , in the area where it contr@@ ols emotions .
It &apos;s been shown to promot@@ e pre-@@ fron@@ tal cortex development where a lot of cogni@@ tion is happening .
As a result , what happens ?
We develop more emotional mat@@ urity if we play more .
We develop better deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are facts .
It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
These are the benefits to play .
It is a genetic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
And if we han@@ dic@@ ap ourselves with play , we han@@ dic@@ ap ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have .
We hold ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without d@@ ancing , without so@@ c@@ cer , without foot@@ ball , without l@@ aughter .
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty ble@@ ak .
It &apos;s pretty glu@@ m .
Now imagine your work@@ place .
Is it fun ? Is it play@@ ful ?
Or maybe the work@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
Is it fun ? Is it play@@ ful ?
Or is it cra@@ p ? Is it auto@@ cr@@ atic , contro@@ lling , restric@@ tive and un@@ tr@@ ust@@ ing and un@@ ful@@ fi@@ lling ?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
&quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laugh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my bos@@ s might see me .
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is back@@ wards .
The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
is depression . It &apos;s depression .
In fact , play impro@@ ves our work .
Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
For example , it stimul@@ ates creativity .
It incre@@ ases our open@@ ness to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
It provi@@ des a sense of purpose and ma@@ st@@ ery — two key motiv@@ ational things that increase produc@@ tivity , through play .
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous .
You know , the professional ath@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he lo@@ ves it .
He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the flow .
A doctor might be serious , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
Our thinking is back@@ wards .
We shouldn &apos;t be feeling gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be celebr@@ ating play .
Qu@@ ick example from the corpor@@ ate world .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy mot@@ to : people , service , profit .
If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happi@@ er , they &apos;re ful@@ filled , they have a sense of ma@@ st@@ ery and purpose .
What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
And when cust@@ omers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are ful@@ filled , how do the cust@@ omers feel ? They feel great .
And what do great cust@@ omers do , great@@ -@@ feeling cust@@ omers ?
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
People , service , profit .
P@@ lay incre@@ ases produc@@ tivity , not dec@@ reas@@ es .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Ge@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bu@@ l@@ g@@ aria .
No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bu@@ l@@ g@@ aria , you guys . Two reasons .
One , play is universal .
There &apos;s nothing weird about Bu@@ l@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , b@@ es@@ ides the serious mem@@ e that we have to k@@ ick out .
Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sci@@ ant .
When I got there , we had zero happy cust@@ omers .
Not one cust@@ om@@ er would re@@ fer us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ gin@@ al profit — I did .
We had mar@@ gin@@ al prof@@ its , and we had un@@ happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders .
Th@@ r@@ ough some basic change , change like impro@@ ving transpar@@ ency , change like promot@@ ing self-@@ direction and collabor@@ ation , encour@@ aging collabor@@ ation , not auto@@ cr@@ acy , the things like having a result@@ s-@@ focus .
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cust@@ om@@ er and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;@@ clock ?
B@@ asi@@ cally promot@@ ing fun .
Th@@ r@@ ough promot@@ ing fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sci@@ ant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every cust@@ om@@ er , from zero to every cust@@ om@@ er refer@@ ring us , above average prof@@ its for the industry and happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we enter@@ ed , one of the ran@@ k@@ ings for best employ@@ er for small business .
In@@ depend@@ ent analysis from an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous employees on their surve@@ ys .
It does , and it can , work in Bu@@ l@@ g@@ aria .
There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own ment@@ ality about play .
So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
First of all , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to re@@ discover play .
W@@ hat@@ ever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjo@@ yed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pro@@ motion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , re@@ discover it .
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain bi@@ king or reading a book or playing a game .
Re@@ discover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ig@@ ni@@ te the fire of change in the play revolution .
You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; We@@ ird concept : I hi@@ red you ; I should trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to del@@ eg@@ ate to the low@@ est level , rather than the top .
I &apos;m going to encour@@ age construc@@ tive cri@@ tici@@ sm .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge auth@@ ority .
Because it &apos;s by challen@@ ging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the ru@@ t that we &apos;re in and create innov@@ ative solutions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
We &apos;re going to er@@ adic@@ ate fear .
F@@ ear is the enem@@ y of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like elimin@@ ate restric@@ tions .
You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heav@@ en for@@ bi@@ d .
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on inst@@ ant mess@@ eng@@ ers .
Let them take long lun@@ ches .
L@@ unch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ charge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some syn@@ erg@@ y of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
Let them do it . Gi@@ ve them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the work@@ place .
We spend so much of our lives at the work@@ place , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miser@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Un@@ accep@@ table . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mary , we need a dr@@ astic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing .
S@@ eri@@ ously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the u@@ pri@@ sing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fl@@ ames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
of what worked about re@@ invi@@ gor@@ ating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promot@@ es a sense of promise and self-@@ ful@@ fi@@ ll@@ ment ; of how play promot@@ es innovation and produc@@ tivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bu@@ l@@ g@@ aria for the better .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I want to start by offer@@ ing you a free no@@ -@@ tech life hac@@ k , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes .
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audi@@ t of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
So , we &apos;re really fascin@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward interaction , or a s@@ mile , or a cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a hand@@ sha@@ ke .
N@@ arr@@ ator : Here they are arri@@ ving at Nu@@ mber 10 .
Even the B@@ BC and The New York Times .
So obviously when we think about non@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interac@@ tions .
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a vali@@ d way to look at this .
And we make swe@@ eping jud@@ g@@ ments and infer@@ ences from body language .
And those jud@@ g@@ ments can predict really mean@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or promot@@ e , who we ask out on a date .
For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ mb@@ ady , a research@@ er at Tu@@ f@@ ts University , shows that when people watch 3@@ 0-@@ second so@@ und@@ less cli@@ ps of real physici@@ an-@@ patient interac@@ tions , their jud@@ g@@ ments of the physici@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ eness predict whether or not that physici@@ an will be su@@ ed .
If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . Right ?
We are also influ@@ enced by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thoughts and our feelings and our phy@@ si@@ ology .
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logist . I study pre@@ judi@@ ce , and I teach at a competi@@ tive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dy@@ nam@@ ics .
I became especially interested in non@@ ver@@ b@@ al expres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ b@@ al expres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance ?
So in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding .
So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
It &apos;s about opening up .
This expres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , Jes@@ sica Tr@@ acy has studied .
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mir@@ ror them .
So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the class@@ room , and what do I notice ?
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
You have other people who are vir@@ tually collap@@ sing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
I notice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
Women feel chr@@ on@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A class@@ room , because particip@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the grade .
So business schools have been stru@@ ggl@@ ing with this gender grade gap .
So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re particip@@ ating .
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
So , for example , we s@@ mile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to s@@ mile by holding a p@@ en in our te@@ eth like this , it makes us feel happy .
So it goes both ways .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the power@@ less look like ?
So powerful people tend to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more confid@@ ent , more optimis@@ tic .
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stress .
So do you want the high-@@ power leader that &apos;s domin@@ ant , high on test@@ o@@ ster@@ one , but really stress reac@@ tive ?
Probab@@ ly not , right ?
So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this tiny manipul@@ ation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-@@ power pos@@ es .
So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ecting yourself .
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on test@@ o@@ ster@@ one .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ sol .
So it seems that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
Al@@ so , our bodies change our minds .
And so we think where you want to use this is evalu@@ ative situ@@ ations , like social threat situ@@ ations .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led .
People hate this .
We then have these co@@ ders look at these tap@@ es , four of them .
They &apos;re blind to the hypo@@ thesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
These kinds of things .
So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or medi@@ ating the effect .
So I said , fa@@ ke it till you make it .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fr@@ au@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
I was thro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ lled several times .
I was thro@@ wn from the car .
I knew my I@@ Q because I had identi@@ fied with being smart , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child .
So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
Like , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it .
So she had changed .
And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it till you make it .
F@@ ake it till you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and intern@@ alize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ e@@ aks can lead to big changes .
So , this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your test@@ o@@ ster@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ sol down .
Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
Thank you .
Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
Dis@@ cu@@ ss . Great creativity is ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , ab@@ sur@@ dly , r@@ ation@@ ally , ir@@ r@@ ation@@ ally powerful .
Great creativity can spread toler@@ ance , cha@@ mpi@@ on freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spo@@ t@@ light on de@@ priv@@ ation , or show that de@@ priv@@ ation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
Great creativity can make politicians el@@ ect@@ able , or parti@@ es un@@ el@@ ect@@ able .
It can make war seem like trag@@ edy or far@@ ce .
Cre@@ ativ@@ ity is the mem@@ e-@@ ma@@ ker that puts s@@ log@@ ans on our t-@@ shi@@ r@@ ts and ph@@ r@@ ases on our li@@ ps .
It &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that shows us a simple road through an im@@ pene@@ tr@@ able moral ma@@ ze .
Sci@@ ence is cle@@ ver , but great creativity is something less know@@ able , more mag@@ ical . And now we need that magic .
This is a time of need .
Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provo@@ ke us to think differently with dram@@ atic creative stat@@ ements .
To t@@ emp@@ t us to act differently with deli@@ ght@@ ful creative scr@@ aps .
Here is one such sc@@ ra@@ p from an initi@@ ative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspi@@ re people to be green@@ er .
( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
N@@ arr@@ ator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
S@@ tran@@ ge and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
A de@@ er with an itch@@ y leg . A flying mot@@ or@@ cycle .
A father and daughter separ@@ ated from a bic@@ y@@ cle by a myst@@ eri@@ ous wall .
And then he stopped . Wal@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had s@@ ki@@ pped with him through fields and broken his heart .
S@@ ure , she had aged a little .
In fact , she had aged a lot .
But he felt all his old passion for her return .
&quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called sof@@ tly . For that was her name .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , G@@ ust@@ y , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
&quot; &quot; I know a t@@ ent next to a car@@ av@@ an , exactly 300 y@@ ards from here .
Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the t@@ ent . &quot; &quot; Ford und@@ res@@ sed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
G@@ ust@@ y enter@@ ed her bol@@ dly and made love to her rhyth@@ mic@@ ally while she fil@@ med him , because she was a k@@ een am@@ ate@@ ur por@@ no@@ grap@@ her .
The earth moved for both of them .
And they lived together happi@@ ly ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
( Applause ) An@@ dy H@@ obs@@ b@@ aw@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
The moral im@@ per@@ ative is on the table .
Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and shar@@ p .
To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
So this is a call , a pl@@ ea , to the incredibly tal@@ ented TED community .
Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
( Applause )
Be@@ au L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
Okay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Audience : Can you read this ?
B@@ L : Ama@@ zing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Audience : You are not reading this .
B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Por@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
B@@ L : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
It literally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because percep@@ tion is gro@@ unded in our experience .
Right ? The brain takes mean@@ ing@@ less information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
All right ? Which means , when it comes to percep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this fro@@ g .
( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit anno@@ yed , right ?
But we &apos;re talking about percep@@ tion here , right ?
And percep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our ho@@ pes , our dreams , the clo@@ th@@ es we wear , fall@@ ing in love , everything begins with percep@@ tion .
Now if percep@@ tion is gro@@ unded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cording to what we &apos;ve done before .
But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new percep@@ tions begin in the same way .
They begin with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ certain@@ ty .
Now , un@@ certain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolu@@ tion@@ arily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even se@@ asi@@ ck@@ ness is a consequ@@ ence of un@@ certain@@ ty .
Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
Your brain cannot deal with the un@@ certain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill .
The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ certain@@ ty .
And yet , the ir@@ ony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
And it en@@ ables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ certain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what exten@@ ds beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really st@@ ep@@ ping into that space .
So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ certain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . Ex@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ lay is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ certain@@ ty is actually celebr@@ ated . Un@@ certain@@ ty is what makes play fun .
Right ? It &apos;s adap@@ table to change . Right ? It open@@ s possibility , and it &apos;s cooper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bon@@ ding , and it &apos;s intr@@ in@@ sic@@ ally motiv@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ lay is its own re@@ ward .
Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
Sci@@ ence is not defined by the method section of a paper .
It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
So arm@@ ed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
And who better to ask than 25 ei@@ ght@@ - to 10@@ -year-old children ?
Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fun@@ ding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribu@@ tion to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther reading it . Po@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science public@@ ation the last five to 15 years . Right ?
So they were asking questions that were significant to exper@@ t scientists .
Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ g@@ est published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youn@@ g@@ est person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
Now , science and asking questions is about cour@@ age .
Now she is the person@@ i@@ fication of cour@@ age , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
So A@@ my , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es Pro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , A@@ my .
A@@ my O &apos;@@ To@@ ole : Thank you , Be@@ au . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke .
But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if bees can also adap@@ t themselves to new situ@@ ations using previ@@ ously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an ins@@ ect with only one million brain cells .
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flo@@ wer regar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any ang@@ le they approach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzz@@ le that you set the bees ?
A@@ O : The puzz@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then rule .
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the yellow f@@ lowers if the yellow f@@ lowers were surro@@ unded by the blue , or if the blue f@@ lowers were surro@@ unded by the yellow .
Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzz@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?
What was really exciting about this project was we , and Be@@ au , had no idea whether it would work .
It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clu@@ e what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to D@@ ave S@@ tr@@ ud@@ w@@ ick , who was the collabor@@ ator on this project . Okay ?
So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observ@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the observ@@ ations . They &apos;re recor@@ ding the data of where the bees fly .
( Video ) D@@ ave S@@ tr@@ ud@@ w@@ ick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Stu@@ d@@ ent : 5@@ C .
D@@ ave S@@ tr@@ ud@@ w@@ ick : Is she still going up here ? Stu@@ d@@ ent : Yeah .
D@@ ave S@@ tr@@ ud@@ w@@ ick : So you keep track of e@@ ach@@ .@@ Stu@@ d@@ ent : Hen@@ ry , can you help me here ?
B@@ L : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Hen@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
Stu@@ d@@ ent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observ@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
They do the simple mathematics , aver@@ aging , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ mit this for public@@ ation . Right ? So we have to write it up .
So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sec@@ tions : an introduc@@ tion , a meth@@ ods , a results , a discus@@ sion .
The introduc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
M@@ eth@@ ods , what did you do ? Resul@@ ts , what was the observ@@ ation ?
And the discus@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? Right ?
That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kid@@ speak .
It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by A@@ my and the other students in the class . As a consequ@@ ence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Tra@@ ining pha@@ se , the puzz@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the meth@@ ods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fri@@ dge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; s@@ mi@@ ley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle page . We have a number of auth@@ ors there .
All the ones in bo@@ ld are eight to 10 years old .
The first auth@@ or is B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Pri@@ mary School , because if it were ever refer@@ enced , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we sub@@ mit it to a public access journ@@ al , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fail@@ s our initi@@ al quality control chec@@ ks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figur@@ es are in cra@@ y@@ on , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vie@@ wed . So I sent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the National Ac@@ adem@@ y of Sci@@ ence , one of the leading neuro@@ scientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deser@@ ves wide ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;
L@@ arry Mal@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is mag@@ nific@@ ent .
The work would be publi@@ sha@@ ble if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the edi@@ tor .
They say no .
So we asked L@@ arry and N@@ at@@ ali@@ e H@@ emp@@ el to write a com@@ ment@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scientists , right , putting in the refer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters .
And there , it was re@@ vie@@ wed by five independent refer@@ ees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) T@@ y@@ pic@@ al science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ g@@ est published scientists in the world .
What was the feedback like ?
Well , it was published two days before Christ@@ mas , down@@ lo@@ aded 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?
It was the E@@ di@@ tors &apos; C@@ ho@@ ice in Sci@@ ence , which is a top science magazine .
It &apos;s forever fre@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be fre@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by this journ@@ al .
Last year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most down@@ lo@@ aded paper by Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
C@@ uri@@ osi@@ ty , interest , inno@@ c@@ ence and z@@ eal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
Who else can have these qu@@ alities more than children ?
Please con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclu@@ de with a physical metaphor .
Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
S@@ him@@ on Sch@@ oc@@ ken : Right , but I like myself .
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ o@@ me of technology . Right . Okay .
Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstr@@ ation , right ?
You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ ap@@ ping . All right ?
( C@@ lap@@ ping ) ( C@@ lap@@ ping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?
Audience : ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) Bri@@ lli@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
Every@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
Right ? We normally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ certain@@ ty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
That &apos;s what science offer@@ s us . It offer@@ s the possibility to step on un@@ certain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?
Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and en@@ ab@@ ling to expres@@ s that voice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last voice in this short story .
So , A@@ my ?
A@@ O : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
Ch@@ an@@ ging the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depen@@ ds on the way the person feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was surpri@@ sing@@ ly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzz@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Be@@ au , and the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ e Pro@@ ject .
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Sk@@ ep@@ tical En@@ viron@@ ment@@ alist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
So get out your p@@ en and paper .
B@@ ot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean dr@@ inking water .
Two billion people without sanit@@ ation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two billions of people who will be sever@@ ely affected by climate change — so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy ses@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We identi@@ fied 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just bri@@ ef@@ ly read them : climate change , communic@@ able diseases , conflic@@ ts , education , financial inst@@ ability , govern@@ ance and corruption , mal@@ nutri@@ tion and hun@@ ger , population migr@@ ation , sanit@@ ation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and trade barri@@ ers .
We believe that these in many ways en@@ com@@ pass the biggest problems in the world .
The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
Where should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ avos in Jan@@ uary .
But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Su@@ rely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
So the point is not to priori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to priori@@ ti@@ ze solutions to problems .
And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
To climate change that would be like K@@ y@@ o@@ to .
To communic@@ able diseases , it might be health clin@@ ics or mos@@ quito ne@@ ts .
To conflic@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ace@@ keeping forces , and so on .
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priori@@ ties .
And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighb@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top priori@@ ties and the bottom priori@@ ties of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a subst@@ anti@@ al amount of my time , right ?
I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And I also str@@ ong@@ ly encour@@ age you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discus@@ sions after@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually priori@@ ti@@ ze ?
Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
And one reason is that priori@@ tiz@@ ation is incredibly un@@ comfortable .
No@@ body wants to do this .
Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
And since there are many more not@@ -@@ nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ one spo@@ ts on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not priori@@ tiz@@ ing — any decision is a priori@@ tiz@@ ation , so of course we are still priori@@ tiz@@ ing , if only impli@@ ci@@ tly — and that &apos;s un@@ likely to be as good as if we actually did the priori@@ tiz@@ ation , and went in and talked about it .
So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pr@@ ices , n@@ or the si@@ zes .
We have not had an idea .
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big men@@ u card , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , you have a piz@@ za ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a fam@@ il@@ y-@@ size piz@@ za ; it could be a very individu@@ al-@@ size piz@@ za , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the Co@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus is really trying to do — to try to put pr@@ ices on these issues .
And so basically , this has been the Co@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus &apos; process .
We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economi@@ sts , three in each area .
So we have three of world &apos;s top economi@@ sts write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wise in communic@@ able diseases .
Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?
And so on .
Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economi@@ sts , eight of the world &apos;s top economi@@ sts , including three Nobel L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , meet in Co@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen in M@@ ay 2004 .
We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Re@@ al Mad@@ rid of economics .
That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
And what they basically did was come out with a priori@@ ti@@ zed list .
And then you ask , why economi@@ sts ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria exper@@ t .
If you want to know about climate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ olog@@ ist .
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
That is what economi@@ sts do .
They priori@@ ti@@ ze .
They make that in some ways dis@@ gust@@ ing task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do after@@ wards ?
So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
I &apos;m going to go from back@@ wards so that we end up with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ agree with on the list that you wrote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ o@@ to — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ o@@ to — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ efficient .
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
What they basically show us , the average of all mac@@ ro@@ economic models , is that K@@ y@@ o@@ to , if everyone agre@@ ed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a subst@@ anti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Th@@ ird World every year .
Yet it would do very little good .
All models show it will post@@ pone warming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in Ban@@ gl@@ ad@@ esh who gets a f@@ loo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can wait until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
And just to give you a sense of refer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually esti@@ mate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
We could give clean dr@@ inking water , sanit@@ ation , basic heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ ority .
The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communic@@ able diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very cost@@ ly .
Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equ@@ ation .
If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanit@@ ation and water projects came in .
Again , sanit@@ ation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priori@@ ties which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
The incid@@ ence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get inf@@ ected every year .
It might even cost up towards a perc@@ ent@@ age point of GDP every year for affected nations .
If we invest@@ ed about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incid@@ ence down to half .
We could avoid about 5@@ 00,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting inf@@ ected every year .
We would signific@@ antly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
This third best one was free trade .
B@@ asi@@ cally , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global economy to an ast@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2,@@ 400 billion dollars a year , half of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to the Th@@ ird World .
Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radic@@ ally fast , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on mal@@ nutri@@ tion .
Not just mal@@ nutri@@ tion in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with mal@@ nutri@@ tion , nam@@ ely , the lack of mic@@ r@@ on@@ u@@ tri@@ ents .
B@@ asi@@ cally , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ ac@@ king in ir@@ on , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and vit@@ am@@ in A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ road into that problem .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
B@@ asi@@ cally , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what it focu@@ ses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than pre@@ ven@@ tion .
So basically , what this focu@@ ses on is saying , we can do a lot more by invest@@ ing in pre@@ ven@@ tion .
B@@ asi@@ cally for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion .
So again , what we focus on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than treatment , at first rate .
What this really does is that it makes us think about our priori@@ ties .
I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ ority list and say , did you get it right ?
Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ likely that we should do that .
We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
And I think , actually — Thomas Sch@@ el@@ ling , one of the particip@@ ants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change imp@@ acts will be , people will be much , much ric@@ her .
Even the most pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic impact sc@@ en@@ arios of the U.@@ N@@ .
esti@@ mate that the average person in the developing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as rich as we are today .
Mu@@ ch more likely , they will be two to four times ric@@ her than we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even ric@@ her than that .
But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Ban@@ gl@@ ad@@ esh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Ban@@ gl@@ ad@@ es@@ hi .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Du@@ t@@ ch guy .
And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Du@@ t@@ ch guy ?
Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Ban@@ gl@@ ad@@ esh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very che@@ a@@ ply ?
Or as Sch@@ el@@ ling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a rich Con@@ gol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and car@@ ed so fairly little about helping my grand@@ father and my great grand@@ father , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priori@@ ties straight .
Even if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cord to the typical way we see this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s main@@ ly because climate change has good pictures .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay After To@@ morrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Em@@ mer@@ ich to cas@@ t Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next movie dig@@ ging l@@ atr@@ ines in T@@ anz@@ ania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
So in many ways , I think of the Co@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus and the whole discus@@ sion of priori@@ ties as a def@@ ense for bor@@ ing problems .
To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
The other obj@@ ec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — pos@@ iting a fal@@ se choice .
Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 19@@ 70 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the developing world .
Since then our aid has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly sol@@ ving all big problems .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
I &apos;m all for that .
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priori@@ ties .
I should just men@@ tion bri@@ ef@@ ly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economi@@ sts , you inevit@@ ably end up asking old , white American men .
And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two requi@@ re@@ ments were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
They had all the same material but they could go v@@ ast@@ ly outside the s@@ cope of discus@@ sion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with mal@@ nutri@@ tion and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There &apos;s been many other sem@@ in@@ ars and university students , and different things .
They all come out with very much the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priori@@ ties , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
I see the Co@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus as a process .
We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assem@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 20@@ 12 .
Ma@@ p out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can dis@@ agree with the discus@@ sion of how we actually priori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be honest and fr@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
If we worry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things .
So I hope this will help us make better priori@@ ties , and think about how we better work for the world .
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A curious little inven@@ tion is being talked about .
It &apos;s called a micros@@ cope .
What it allows you to do is see tiny little life@@ forms that are invisible to the na@@ ked eye .
So@@ on comes the medical discovery that many of these life@@ forms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was dr@@ inking a mon@@ ster sou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from London .
F@@ ast forward 200 years .
We still have this mon@@ ster sou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the trop@@ ical bel@@ t .
Just for malaria itself , there are a million dea@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be test@@ ed because they are at risk for different species of mal@@ ari@@ al infec@@ tions .
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ sters .
You take a st@@ ain , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ ange or a flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ent st@@ ain or Gi@@ em@@ sa , and a micros@@ cope , and you look at them .
They all have faces .
Why is that so , that Ale@@ x in Kenya , F@@ ati@@ ma in Ban@@ gl@@ ad@@ esh , N@@ av@@ jo@@ ot in Mu@@ mb@@ ai , and Ju@@ lie and M@@ ary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diag@@ nose why they are sick ?
And that &apos;s prim@@ arily because scal@@ ability of the diagnos@@ tics is completely out of reach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the micros@@ cope itself .
Even though the pin@@ nac@@ le of modern science , research micros@@ co@@ pes are not designed for field testing .
N@@ either were they first designed for diagnos@@ tics at all .
They are heavy , bul@@ ky , really hard to main@@ tain , and cost a lot of money .
This picture is Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the exact same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for diagnos@@ ing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his ash@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ agr@@ am in India .
Two of my students , Jim and James , travel@@ ed around India and T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , starting to think about this problem a lot .
We saw all kinds of don@@ ated equipment .
We saw fun@@ gu@@ s growing on micros@@ cope l@@ enses .
And we saw people who had a func@@ tional micros@@ cope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pes .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ cope ?
A F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ cope is a completely func@@ tional micros@@ cope , a platform for flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ence , bri@@ ght-@@ field , pol@@ ariz@@ ation , proj@@ ection , all kinds of advanced micros@@ copy built pu@@ rely by fol@@ ding paper .
So , now you think , how is that possible ?
I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
It starts with a single she@@ et of paper .
What you see here is all the possible compon@@ ents to build a func@@ tional bri@@ ght-@@ field and flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ence micros@@ cope .
So , there are three st@@ ages : There is the op@@ tical stage , the illu@@ min@@ ation stage and the mas@@ k@@ -@@ holding stage .
And there are mic@@ ro op@@ tics at the bottom that &apos;s actually em@@ bed@@ ded in the paper itself .
What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I break it off .
This paper has no instruc@@ tions and no languages .
There is a code , a color code em@@ bed@@ ded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific micros@@ cope .
When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the func@@ tion@@ alities of a standard micros@@ cope , just like an X@@ Y stage , a place where a sam@@ ple slide could go , for example right here .
We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimi@@ zed for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
So this is what changes , but the standard st@@ ains all re@@ main the same for many different diseases .
You pop this in .
There is an X@@ Y stage , and then there is a focu@@ sing stage , which is a fle@@ x@@ ure mechan@@ ism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the l@@ enses by mic@@ r@@ on steps .
So what &apos;s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this anyway , is these are ru@@ g@@ ged devices .
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
Another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diag@@ no@@ stic tool , but here in this en@@ vel@@ op@@ e I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pes of different configur@@ ations all in a single fol@@ der .
And I &apos;m going to pick one ran@@ dom@@ ly .
This one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ent fil@@ ters built specifically for diagnos@@ ing malaria .
So the idea of very specific diag@@ no@@ stic micros@@ co@@ pes comes out of this .
So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps .
So what I would like to do is , if we could di@@ m the lights , please , it turns out fol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pes are also proj@@ ection micros@@ co@@ pes .
I have these two micros@@ co@@ pes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cros@@ s-@@ section of a com@@ po@@ und eye , and when I &apos;m going to zo@@ om in closer , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ ax@@ is .
You actually see how the l@@ enses are cut together in the cros@@ s-@@ section pattern .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mos@@ quito , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ na of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens .
Right there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually described .
So my wife has been field testing some of our micros@@ co@@ pes by was@@ h@@ ing my clo@@ th@@ es wh@@ enever I forget them in the dr@@ yer .
So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
This also shows you how the proj@@ ection s@@ cope works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s proj@@ ected and b@@ ent .
Can we get the lights back on again ?
So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufac@@ ture , the biggest idea was ro@@ ll@@ -@@ to-@@ roll manufactur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of parts and costs .
( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradig@@ m in micros@@ copy , which we call us@@ e-@@ and-@@ throw micros@@ copy .
I &apos;m going to give you a quick sn@@ ap@@ shot of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a she@@ et of paper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 she@@ et of paper .
These are the three st@@ ages that you actually see .
And the op@@ tical compon@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufac@@ ture l@@ enses in paper itself at really high through@@ puts , so it uses a process of self-@@ assem@@ bly and surface ten@@ sion to build ach@@ ro@@ matic l@@ enses in the paper itself .
So that &apos;s where the l@@ enses go .
There are some light sources .
And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of ori@@ gami , because of the fact that ori@@ gami allows us mic@@ r@@ on-@@ scale preci@@ sion of op@@ tical ali@@ gn@@ ment .
So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the asp@@ ects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophistic@@ ated .
So here is another obvious thing that we would do , typic@@ ally , if I was going to show that these micros@@ co@@ pes are rob@@ ust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
There it is , and it sur@@ vi@@ ves .
So for us , the next step actually is really fin@@ ishing our field tri@@ als .
We are starting at the end of the summer .
We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of micros@@ co@@ pes .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field tri@@ als with the highest densi@@ ty of micros@@ co@@ pes ever at a given place .
We &apos;ve started coll@@ ecting data for malaria , Cha@@ gas disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from patients themselves .
And I want to leave you with this picture .
I had not anticip@@ ated this before , but a really interesting link between hand@@ s-@@ on science education and global health .
What are the tools that we &apos;re actually provi@@ ding the kids who are going to fight this mon@@ ster sou@@ p for tomorrow ?
I would love for them to be able to just print out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ cope and carry them around in their po@@ ck@@ ets .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Our world has many super@@ hero@@ es .
But they have the worst of all super@@ po@@ wers : in@@ visi@@ bility .
For example , the cat@@ adores , workers who collect recy@@ cl@@ able materials for a living .
C@@ at@@ adores emerg@@ ed from social in@@ equality , un@@ employ@@ ment , and the abund@@ ance of soli@@ d waste from the de@@ fici@@ ency of the waste collection system .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recy@@ cl@@ ed .
Most of the cat@@ adores work independ@@ ently , pic@@ king waste from the streets and selling to jun@@ k y@@ ards at very low pr@@ ices .
They may collect over 300 ki@@ los in their b@@ ags , sho@@ pping car@@ ts , bic@@ y@@ cles and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
And this is how I first met these mar@@ gin@@ alized super@@ hero@@ es .
I am a gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i artist and activi@@ st and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new urban support for my message .
But at this time , giving voice to the cat@@ adores .
By ad@@ ding art and humor to the cause , it became more appe@@ aling , which helped call attention to the cat@@ adores and improve their self-@@ est@@ e@@ em .
And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
I have pain@@ ted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been invited to do exhibi@@ tions and tri@@ ps world@@ wide .
And then I realized that cat@@ adores , in their in@@ visi@@ bility , are not exclu@@ sive to Brazil .
I met them in Ar@@ gent@@ ina , Chi@@ le , Bo@@ li@@ via , South Africa , Tur@@ key and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
And then , I created a collabor@@ ative movement called P@@ im@@ p My C@@ arro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ded event .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My C@@ arro@@ ç@@ a is a large crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ded event to help cat@@ adores and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
C@@ at@@ adores are as@@ sist@@ ed by well-@@ being profes@@ sion@@ als and heal@@ th@@ care , like physici@@ ans , d@@ enti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ a@@ tri@@ sts , hair st@@ y@@ li@@ sts , mas@@ s@@ age ther@@ api@@ sts and much more .
But also , they also recei@@ ve safety shi@@ r@@ ts , glo@@ ves , ra@@ in@@ co@@ ats and ey@@ eg@@ las@@ ses to see in high-@@ definition the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are renov@@ ated by our incredible volunte@@ ers .
And then they recei@@ ve safety it@@ ems , too : refl@@ ective tap@@ es , hor@@ ns and mir@@ r@@ ors .
P@@ im@@ p My C@@ arro@@ ç@@ a took to the streets of S@@ ã@@ o Pau@@ lo , R@@ io de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ uri@@ ti@@ ba .
But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is inspired by TED@@ x , and it &apos;s a simpli@@ fied , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ded edi@@ tion of P@@ im@@ p My C@@ arro@@ ç@@ a .
So now everybody can join .
In two years , over 1@@ 70 cat@@ adores , 800 volunte@@ ers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 don@@ ors have been involved in the P@@ im@@ p My C@@ arro@@ ç@@ a movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recy@@ cl@@ ing at a local school .
So cat@@ adores are leaving in@@ visi@@ bility behind and becoming increasingly resp@@ ected and valu@@ ed .
Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fight back to pre@@ judi@@ ce , increase their income and their interaction with society .
So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the cat@@ adores and other invisible super@@ hero@@ es from your city .
T@@ ry to see the world as one , without bo@@ und@@ aries or fron@@ ti@@ ers .
B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million cat@@ adores world@@ wide .
So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
Mu@@ ito ob@@ ri@@ gado , thank you .
( Applause ) .
Ab@@ out a year and a half ago , Ste@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Vir@@ tual Earth , brought me over to become the archit@@ ect of B@@ ing M@@ aps , which is Microsoft &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ ma@@ pping effort .
In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ defin@@ ing the way ma@@ ps work online .
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of ma@@ pping and direction site that one is used to .
So , the first thing that you might notice about the ma@@ pping site is just the flu@@ idi@@ ty of the zo@@ om@@ ing and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Se@@ ad@@ r@@ ag@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from .
M@@ ap@@ ping is , of course , not just about carto@@ graph@@ y , it &apos;s also about ima@@ gery .
So , as we zo@@ om@@ -@@ in beyond a certain level this resol@@ ves into a kind of Si@@ m C@@ it@@ y-@@ like virtual view at 45 degrees .
This can be vie@@ wed from any of the car@@ din@@ al direc@@ tions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the fac@@ ades .
Now , we see this space , this three-@@ dimensional environment , as being a can@@ vas on which all sorts of applic@@ ations can play out , and map &apos;s direc@@ tions are really just one of them .
If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
So , for example , a couple of days after the dis@@ aster in Hait@@ i , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ local blo@@ gs in real time and ma@@ pping those stories , those entr@@ i@@ es to the places that are refer@@ red to on the blo@@ gs .
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more c@@ and@@ y sort of stuff .
So , we see the ima@@ gery , of course , not stop@@ ping at the sky .
These little green bu@@ b@@ bles represent phot@@ os@@ yn@@ ths that users have made .
I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them either , but phot@@ os@@ yn@@ ths are integr@@ ated into the map .
Everything that &apos;s cas@@ ed in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken ima@@ gery on the ground as well .
And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ amic ima@@ gery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-@@ dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-@@ dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transi@@ tion looks as it does , is a function of all of that geo@@ metry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a collabor@@ ation with our friends at F@@ lic@@ k@@ r .
This takes F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , geo@@ regi@@ ster@@ ed ima@@ gery and uses phot@@ os@@ yn@@ th-@@ like processes to connect that ima@@ gery to our ima@@ gery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tou@@ ri@@ st site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
So this one was taken around five .
So that &apos;s the F@@ lic@@ k@@ r photo , that &apos;s our ima@@ gery .
So you really see how this kind of crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced ima@@ gery is integr@@ ating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful histori@@ c ima@@ gery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and carri@@ ages and so on as well .
But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it au@@ g@@ ment@@ ing this visual represent@@ ation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for au@@ g@@ ment@@ ed reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
Now I just made a transi@@ tion in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
OK , notice there &apos;s now a ro@@ of above us .
We &apos;re inside the Pi@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ ket .
And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a back@@ p@@ ack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only ima@@ ging in the street with this camera on to@@ ps of cars , but we &apos;re also ima@@ ging inside .
And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registr@@ ation , not only of still images , but also of video .
So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
( Laughter ) OK .
( R@@ inging ) All right , guys , are you there ?
( No@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m h@@ itting it . I &apos;m pun@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
So , these are our friends in Pi@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ ket , the lab .
( Applause ) So they &apos;re broad@@ c@@ asting this live .
OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
Because I want to show points of interest .
No , no . The other way .
Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
OK , never mind .
What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to au@@ g@@ ment@@ ed reality .
What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m han@@ ging up now .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pu@@ lling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to aband@@ on them now and walk back outside .
And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for tele@@ pres@@ ence , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the spot , for au@@ g@@ ment@@ ed reality .
When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that met@@ ad@@ ata and information about the world to you .
So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broad@@ c@@ asting it .
That was being broad@@ cas@@ t , by the way , on a 4@@ G network from the market .
All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
And that &apos;s C@@ ur@@ tis W@@ ong , Wor@@ ld@@ Wi@@ de T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe .
So , we &apos;re going to head over to the du@@ mp@@ sters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also st@@ are up at the sky .
This is the integr@@ ation of Wor@@ ld@@ Wi@@ de T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe into our ma@@ ps .
( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we s@@ cru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very deta@@ iled information about different times , different dat@@ es : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
I would like to kind of zo@@ om in on the moon .
So , this is an astron@@ om@@ ically complete represent@@ ation of the sky integr@@ ated right into the Earth .
All right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
And let me start with this .
This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are rock and lots of sea ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to eat the alg@@ ae .
Some@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I ju@@ mp@@ ed in the water for the first time in the Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean co@@ ast off S@@ pain .
Now , if an ali@@ en came to earth — let &apos;s call him Jo@@ e — what would Jo@@ e see ?
If Jo@@ e ju@@ mp@@ ed in a coral re@@ ef , there are many things the ali@@ en could see .
Very un@@ likely , Jo@@ e would jump on a pri@@ st@@ ine coral re@@ ef , a vir@@ gin coral re@@ ef with lots of coral , shar@@ ks , cro@@ codi@@ les , man@@ at@@ ees , grou@@ pers , tur@@ t@@ les , etc .
So , probably , what Jo@@ e would see would be in this part , in the green@@ ish part of the picture .
Here we have the extreme with dead cor@@ als , microbi@@ al sou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the re@@ efs of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , alg@@ ae over@@ growing the cor@@ als , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
And this is what most mar@@ ine scientists have seen too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ ving long after we started degrad@@ ing mar@@ ine ecos@@ yst@@ ems .
So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the L@@ ine Is@@ lands , where we have conduc@@ ted a series of National Ge@@ ographic expedi@@ tions .
This sea is an archi@@ pel@@ ago bel@@ on@@ ging to Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has several un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited , un@@ fi@@ shed , pri@@ st@@ ine is@@ lands and a few in@@ hab@@ ited is@@ lands .
So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christ@@ mas Is@@ land , over 5,000 people .
Most of the re@@ efs are dead , most of the cor@@ als are dead — over@@ grown by alg@@ ae — and most of the fish are smaller than the p@@ enci@@ ls we use to count them .
We did 250 hours of di@@ ving here in 2005 .
We didn &apos;t see a single shar@@ k .
This is the place that Cap@@ tain Co@@ ok discovered in 17@@ 7@@ 7 and he described a huge abund@@ ance of shar@@ ks b@@ iting the r@@ ud@@ ders and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ ats while they were going as@@ hor@@ e .
Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , 2,@@ 500 people .
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many diver@@ s would consider paradi@@ se .
This is where you can see most of the Florida Ke@@ ys National Mar@@ ine S@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine .
If we go back to a place like Pal@@ my@@ ra A@@ to@@ ll , where I was with Jer@@ em@@ y J@@ ack@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are shar@@ ks .
You can see shar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ usual in today &apos;s coral re@@ efs .
But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absolutely healthy and gor@@ ge@@ ous , form@@ ing sp@@ ect@@ acular structures , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 shar@@ ks per di@@ ve .
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the biom@@ ass p@@ y@@ rami@@ d .
If we get all of the fish of a coral re@@ ef together and we@@ i@@ gh them , this is what we would expect .
Most of the biom@@ ass is low on the food chain , the her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , the par@@ rot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that eat the alg@@ ae .
Then the plan@@ k@@ ton feed@@ ers , these little dam@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water .
And then we have a lower biom@@ ass of car@@ ni@@ v@@ ores , and a lower biom@@ ass of top head , or the shar@@ ks , the large sn@@ ap@@ pers , the large grou@@ pers .
But this is a consequ@@ ence .
This view of the world is a consequ@@ ence of having studied degrad@@ ed re@@ efs .
When we went to pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ efs , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this p@@ y@@ rami@@ d was inver@@ ted .
The top head does account for most of the biom@@ ass , in some places up to 85 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ ef , which is now prot@@ ected .
The good news is that , in addition to having more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything .
The size of these bo@@ xes is bigger .
We have more shar@@ ks , more biom@@ ass of sn@@ ap@@ pers , more biom@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ ats .
They clean the re@@ ef ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the re@@ ef clean and allow the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish .
Not only do these places — these ancient , pri@@ st@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important compon@@ ents of the ecos@@ y@@ stem like the giant cl@@ ams ; p@@ av@@ ements of giant cl@@ ams in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
These have dis@@ appeared from every in@@ hab@@ ited re@@ ef in the world , and they fil@@ ter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and path@@ o@@ gen@@ s .
But still , now we have global warming .
If we don &apos;t have fish@@ ing because these re@@ efs are prot@@ ected by law or their remot@@ eness , this is great .
But the water gets war@@ mer for too long and the cor@@ als die .
So how are these fish , these pre@@ dat@@ ors going to help ?
Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El N@@ ino , year &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , the water was too warm for too long , and many cor@@ als ble@@ ached and many died .
In Christ@@ mas , where the food web is really tr@@ im@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not reco@@ vered .
In F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , the cor@@ als are not reco@@ vered .
But you see here a big table coral that died and collap@@ sed .
And the fish have gr@@ az@@ ed the alg@@ ae , so the tur@@ f of alg@@ ae is a little lower .
Then you go to Pal@@ my@@ ra A@@ to@@ ll that has more biom@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , and the dead cor@@ als are clean , and the cor@@ als are coming back .
And when you go to the pri@@ st@@ ine side , did this ever ble@@ ach ?
These places ble@@ ached too , but they reco@@ vered faster .
The more int@@ act , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resili@@ ence , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to reco@@ ver from the shor@@ t-@@ term imp@@ acts of warming events .
And that &apos;s good news , so we need to reco@@ ver that structure .
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecos@@ y@@ stem are there so the ecos@@ y@@ stem can adap@@ t to the effects of global warming .
So if we have to res@@ et the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to push the ecos@@ y@@ stem back to the left , how can we do it ?
Well , there are several ways .
One very clear way is the mar@@ ine prot@@ ected areas , especially no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves that we set asi@@ de to allow for the reco@@ very for mar@@ ine life .
And let me go back to that image of the Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
And at the same time I was watching J@@ ac@@ ques C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au &apos;s shows on TV , with all this r@@ ich@@ ness and abund@@ ance and diversity .
And I thought that this r@@ ich@@ ness bel@@ on@@ ged to trop@@ ical se@@ as , and that the Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean was a natur@@ ally poor sea .
But , little did I know , until I ju@@ mp@@ ed for the first time in a mar@@ ine reser@@ ve .
And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the alg@@ ae grow again .
So you have this little alg@@ al forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of alg@@ ae , mostly micros@@ copi@@ c fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system reco@@ vers .
And this particular place , the M@@ edes Is@@ lands Mar@@ ine Res@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 h@@ ect@@ ares , and it brings 6 million e@@ ur@@ os to the local economy , 20 times more than fish@@ ing , and it repres@@ ents 8@@ 8 percent of all the tou@@ ri@@ st re@@ ven@@ ue .
So these places not only help the ecos@@ y@@ stem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecos@@ y@@ stem .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mary of what no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves do .
These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to un@@ prot@@ ected areas near@@ by , this is what happens .
The number of species incre@@ ases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a mar@@ ine reser@@ ve .
This is very subst@@ anti@@ al .
The size of organisms incre@@ ases a third , so your fish are now this big .
The abund@@ ance , how many fish you have per square meter , incre@@ ases almost 1@@ 70 percent .
And the biom@@ ass — this is the most sp@@ ect@@ acular change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times greater biom@@ ass on average , just after five to seven years .
In some places up to 10 times larger biom@@ ass inside the reser@@ ves .
So we have all these things inside the reser@@ ve that grow , and what do they do ?
They re@@ produce . That &apos;s population biology 10@@ 1 .
If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they re@@ produce a lot .
And same thing for inver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . This is the example .
These are eg@@ g cases l@@ aid by a sn@@ ail off the co@@ ast of Chi@@ le , and this is how many eg@@ gs they lay on the bottom .
O@@ u@@ t@@ side the reser@@ ve , you cannot even det@@ ect this .
One point three million eg@@ gs per square meter inside the mar@@ ine reser@@ ve where these sn@@ ails are very abund@@ ant .
So these organisms re@@ produce , the little lar@@ va@@ e ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es spi@@ ll over , they all spi@@ ll over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
This is in the Ba@@ ha@@ mas : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per .
Hu@@ ge abund@@ ance of grou@@ pers inside the reser@@ ve , and the closer you get to the reser@@ ve , the more fish you have .
So the fish@@ er@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
You can see where the lim@@ its of the reser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats lin@@ ed up .
So there is spi@@ ll over ; there are benefits beyond the bo@@ und@@ aries of these reser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the reser@@ ve is prot@@ ecting the entire habit@@ at . It is building resili@@ ence .
So what we have now — or a world without reser@@ ves — is like a deb@@ it account where we with@@ draw all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
Res@@ er@@ ves are like sav@@ ings accoun@@ ts .
We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produ@@ ces re@@ turns , social , economic and eco@@ logical .
And if we think about the increase of biom@@ ass inside the reser@@ ves , this is like com@@ po@@ und interest .
Two examples , again , of how these reser@@ ves can benefit people .
This is how much fish@@ er@@ men get everyday in Kenya , fish@@ ing over a series of years , in a place where there is no prot@@ ection ; it &apos;s a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all .
Once the most degrad@@ ing fish@@ ing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ moved , the fish@@ er@@ men were cat@@ ching more .
If you fish less , you &apos;re actually cat@@ ching more .
But if we add the no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ve on top of that , the fish@@ er@@ men are still making more money by fish@@ ing less around an area that is prot@@ ected .
Another example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ pers in B@@ eli@@ ze in the M@@ eso@@ amer@@ ican Re@@ ef .
This is grou@@ per sex , and the grou@@ pers ag@@ gre@@ gate around the full mo@@ ons of Dec@@ ember and Jan@@ uary for a week .
They used to ag@@ gre@@ gate up to the tens of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 grou@@ pers about this big in one h@@ ect@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation .
F@@ is@@ her@@ men knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depl@@ et@@ ed them .
When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 grou@@ pers left .
And the fish@@ er@@ men were auth@@ ori@@ zed to catch 30 percent of the entire s@@ pa@@ w@@ ning population every year .
So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ cket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fish@@ ery is going to collap@@ se very quickly .
And with the fish@@ ery , the entire re@@ productive ability of the species goes ext@@ inct .
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fish@@ ery , several fish@@ ing bo@@ ats .
Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 diver@@ s one month per year , the re@@ ven@@ ue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
So how much of this do we have ?
If this is so good , if this is such a no@@ -@@ br@@ ain@@ er , how much of this do we have ?
And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s prot@@ ected .
We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , th@@ anks to the prot@@ ec@@ tions of the Cha@@ gos Ar@@ chi@@ pel@@ ago , and only a fr@@ action of this is fully prot@@ ected from fish@@ ing .
Sci@@ enti@@ fic studies recom@@ men@@ d that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be prot@@ ected .
The esti@@ mat@@ ed range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of go@@ als of bio@@ diversity and fish@@ ery en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement and resili@@ ence .
Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze fish@@ ing : 35 billion dollars per year .
Many of these sub@@ si@@ dies go to destruc@@ tive fish@@ ing practic@@ es .
Well , there are a couple esti@@ mates of how much it would cost to create a network of prot@@ ected areas co@@ vering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fr@@ action of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fish@@ ery that is collap@@ sing .
People are losing their jobs because the fish@@ eries are collap@@ sing .
A creation of a network of reser@@ ves would provide direct employ@@ ment for more than a million people plus all the secon@@ dar@@ y jobs and all the secon@@ dar@@ y benefits .
So how can we do that ?
If it &apos;s so clear that these sav@@ ings accoun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
And how can we reach that goal ?
Well , there are two ways of getting there .
The tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large prot@@ ected areas like the Cha@@ gos Ar@@ chi@@ pel@@ ago .
The problem is that we can create these large reser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this .
But what about the rest of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fish@@ ing ?
Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine reser@@ ves do , and fish@@ er@@ men tend to be really , really defen@@ sive when it comes to regul@@ ating or clo@@ sing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
Second , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ ast@@ al communities around the world don &apos;t have the auth@@ ority to monit@@ or the resources to create the reser@@ ve and en@@ force it .
It &apos;s a top down hier@@ arch@@ ical structure where people wait for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reser@@ ves , is that the fun@@ ding models have been wrong .
N@@ G@@ O@@ s and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
So mar@@ ine conserv@@ ation and co@@ ast@@ al prot@@ ection has become a sin@@ k for government or phi@@ lan@@ thro@@ pi@@ c money , and this is not sustainable .
So the solutions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issues .
First , we need to develop a global awar@@ eness campaign to inspi@@ re local communities and governments to create no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves that are better than what we have now .
It &apos;s the sav@@ ings accoun@@ ts versus the deb@@ it accoun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
Second , we need to re@@ design our govern@@ ance so conserv@@ ation effor@@ ts can be dec@@ entr@@ alized , so conserv@@ ation effor@@ ts don &apos;t depen@@ d on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government ag@@ encies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Phi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines and a few other places .
And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
The phi@@ lan@@ thro@@ py sin@@ k as the only way to create reser@@ ves is not sustainable .
We really need to develop models , business models , where co@@ ast@@ al conserv@@ ation is an investment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine reser@@ ves provide social , eco@@ logical and economic benefits .
And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of part@@ ner@@ ship , truly collabor@@ ative , where we are looking for compl@@ ement@@ ing , not sub@@ stitu@@ ting .
The st@@ akes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c Sal@@ a : Thank you .
CA : That was a ma@@ ster@@ ful job of pu@@ lling things together .
First of all , your p@@ y@@ rami@@ d , your inver@@ ted p@@ y@@ rami@@ d , showing 85 percent biom@@ ass in the pre@@ dat@@ ors , that seems impossible .
How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two g@@ ears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
That &apos;s basically it .
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they re@@ produce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eg@@ gs .
U@@ p there , you have shar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
They re@@ produce very slowly ; they have a slow metabo@@ li@@ sm ; and , basically , they just main@@ tain their biom@@ ass .
So , basically , the production sur@@ plus of these guys down there is enough to main@@ tain this biom@@ ass that is not moving .
They are like capaci@@ tors of the system .
CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
So , really , our picture of a food p@@ y@@ rami@@ d is just — we have to change that completely .
E@@ S : At least in the se@@ as .
What we found in coral re@@ efs is that the inver@@ ted p@@ y@@ rami@@ d is the equivalent of the Ser@@ en@@ get@@ i , with five li@@ ons per wil@@ de@@ be@@ est .
And on land , this cannot work .
But at least on coral re@@ efs are systems where there is a bottom compon@@ ent with structure .
We think this is universal .
But we have started studying pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ efs only very recently .
CA : So the numbers you present@@ ed really are ast@@ on@@ ishing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ dies .
It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as mar@@ ine prot@@ ected areas that actually give new living choices to the fish@@ er@@ men as well .
If the world was a smar@@ ter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ performance of fish@@ eries that is 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Tra@@ de Organ@@ ization shif@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ dies to sustainable practic@@ es .
CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about en@@ ding this sub@@ si@@ dies mad@@ ness .
So thank you for those numbers .
The last one &apos;s a personal question .
A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degrad@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depres@@ sing .
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pri@@ st@@ ine areas and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a spir@@ itual experience .
We go there to try to understand the ecos@@ yst@@ ems , to try to measure or count fish and shar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
But the best feeling is this bi@@ op@@ hi@@ lia that E@@ .@@ O@@ . Wil@@ son talks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and wonder in front of un@@ tam@@ ed nature , of ra@@ w nature .
And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecos@@ y@@ stem .
And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
It would be just too depres@@ sing .
CA : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , thank you so much for sharing some of that spir@@ itual experience with us all . Thank you .
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Pro@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to Por@@ t@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on .
And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ employ@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state par@@ ks and national for@@ ests — basically the long@@ est rou@@ te we can possibly take .
And somewhere in the middle of South D@@ ak@@ ota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2,000 miles .
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
My friend looks at me totally blan@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a gentlem@@ an in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imit@@ ation of her look .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few moments , and then she cr@@ acks up , because she figur@@ es out what I &apos;m talking about .
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situ@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
This might stri@@ ke you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
We get it in the abstr@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes mist@@ akes .
The human species , in general , is fal@@ li@@ ble — okay fine .
But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ efs I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , suddenly all of this abstr@@ act appreci@@ ation of fal@@ li@@ bility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live .
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the po@@ lls and vote in the present ten@@ se .
So effectively , we all kind of wind up travel@@ ing through life , tr@@ apped in this little bu@@ bble of feeling very right about everything .
I think this is a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us coll@@ ectively as a culture .
So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
And finally , I want to conv@@ ince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellec@@ tual and creative le@@ ap you can make .
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ u@@ mb@@ s down .
E@@ mb@@ arr@@ as@@ sing . Okay , wonderful , great .
D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ u@@ mb@@ s down , embar@@ ras@@ sing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
I mean it can be devast@@ ating , it can be revel@@ atory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mist@@ ake .
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an analog@@ y .
Do you remember that Lo@@ ony T@@ un@@ es carto@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ thetic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always cha@@ sing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
In pretty much every epi@@ so@@ de of this carto@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is cha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him .
And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s totally fine too .
He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he fall@@ s .
When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down .
You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on soli@@ d ground .
So I should actually correc@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of ri@@ ght@@ ness .
I call this error bl@@ ind@@ ness .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of intern@@ al cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
Think back for a moment to elem@@ ent@@ ary school .
You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is h@@ anding back qui@@ z papers , and one of them looks like this .
This is not mine , by the way .
( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
It &apos;s the du@@ mb kid , the trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker , the one who never does his home@@ work .
So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are l@@ az@@ y , ir@@ responsible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to succe@@ ed in life is to never make any mist@@ akes .
We learn these really bad les@@ sons really well .
And a lot of us — and I sus@@ p@@ ect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ vers .
Right , Mr. C@@ F@@ O , astr@@ op@@ hy@@ sici@@ st , ultra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ er ?
( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , astr@@ op@@ hy@@ sici@@ sts , ultra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out .
Okay , so fine .
Ex@@ cep@@ t that then we fre@@ ak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
Because ac@@ cording to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
So we just insi@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtu@@ ous and safe .
So let me tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ eth Israel De@@ a@@ con@@ ess Medic@@ al Center for a surgery .
B@@ eth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospit@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the sur@@ geon does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
And she wa@@ kes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ ges ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the sur@@ geon has perform@@ ed a major oper@@ ation on her left leg instead of her right one .
When the v@@ ice president for health care quality at B@@ eth Israel spoke about this incid@@ ent , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the sur@@ geon simply felt that he was on the correc@@ t side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tr@@ ust@@ ing too much in the feeling of being on the correc@@ t side of anything can be very dangerous .
This intern@@ al sense of ri@@ ght@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gui@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ tern@@ al world .
And when we act like it is , and we stop enter@@ tain@@ ing the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 200 million gall@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of Mexico , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global economy .
So this is a huge prac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ efs just perfectly refl@@ ect reality .
And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who dis@@ agree with you ?
It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a series of un@@ fortun@@ ate assu@@ mp@@ tions .
The first thing we usually do when someone dis@@ agre@@ es with us is we just assu@@ me they &apos;re ignor@@ ant .
They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still dis@@ agree with us , then we move on to a second assu@@ mption , which is that they &apos;re idi@@ ots .
( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzz@@ le , and they are too mor@@ onic to put them together correc@@ tly .
And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ agree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assu@@ mption : they know the truth , and they are deliber@@ ately dist@@ or@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es .
So this is a cat@@ astr@@ op@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ ght@@ ness keeps us from pre@@ vent@@ ing mist@@ akes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terri@@ bly .
But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ af@@ fl@@ ing and most trag@@ ic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human .
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly trans@@ luc@@ ent win@@ dows and we just g@@ az@@ e out of them and describe the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to g@@ az@@ e out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly bor@@ ing .
The mir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
1,@@ 200 years before Des@@ car@@ tes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . Au@@ gust@@ ine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r therefore I am . &quot;
Au@@ gust@@ ine understood that our capacity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of embar@@ ras@@ sing def@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ adic@@ ate or over@@ come .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are obs@@ essed with trying to figure it out .
To me , this obs@@ es@@ sion is the source and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ tivity and creativity .
Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of epi@@ so@@ des of the Pu@@ bli@@ c R@@ adi@@ o show This American Life .
And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wr@@ ong@@ ness lady .
I just imagin@@ ed it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ l@@ ass , who &apos;s the ho@@ st of the show .
And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single epi@@ so@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ yp@@ to-@@ them@@ e .
And the cr@@ yp@@ to-@@ them@@ e is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ l@@ ass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
We need these moments of surprise and rever@@ sal and wr@@ ong@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listen@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we eat this stuff up .
We love things like pl@@ ot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and surprise en@@ dings .
When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
George Bush thought he was going to inv@@ ade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruc@@ tion , liber@@ ate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened instead .
And H@@ os@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ ak thought he was going to be the dic@@ t@@ ator of Egyp@@ t for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the re@@ ig@@ ns of power onto his son .
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your home@@ town and raise a bunch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly ner@@ dy book about a subject everybody ha@@ tes for an audience that would never materi@@ alize .
And something else happened instead .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ on@@ ish@@ es us .
No off@@ ense , but this entire conference is an un@@ believ@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
We just spent an entire week talking about innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ ements and impro@@ v@@ ements , but you know why we need all of those innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ ements and impro@@ v@@ ements ?
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ ggl@@ ing and worl@@ d-@@ alter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
Where &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
The them@@ e of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ discovery of wonder .
And to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and complexity and myst@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
On No@@ v@@ ember 5@@ th , 199@@ 0 , a man named El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a hotel in Manhattan and ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ated R@@ ab@@ b@@ i Me@@ ir K@@ ah@@ ane , the leader of the Je@@ wish D@@ ef@@ ense Le@@ agu@@ e .
N@@ os@@ air was initi@@ ally found not gu@@ il@@ ty of the mur@@ der , but while ser@@ ving time on les@@ ser char@@ ges , he and other men began planning att@@ acks on a do@@ zen New York City land@@ mar@@ ks , including tun@@ n@@ els , syn@@ a@@ go@@ gues and the United N@@ ations head@@ quar@@ ters .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , those plan@@ s were fo@@ iled by an F@@ BI infor@@ man@@ t .
S@@ adly , the 199@@ 3 bomb@@ ing of the World Tra@@ de Center was not .
N@@ os@@ air would eventually be convic@@ ted for his invol@@ vement in the pl@@ ot .
El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
I was born in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania in 198@@ 3 to him , an Egyp@@ ti@@ an engineer , and a lo@@ ving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
My father ex@@ posed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Musli@@ ms , get to see .
However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small perc@@ ent@@ age of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beli@@ efs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ rest , he sat me down and expla@@ ined that for the past few wee@@ k@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ oting range on L@@ ong Is@@ land for target practice .
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
We arrived at Cal@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ oting R@@ ange , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being watched by the F@@ BI .
That day , the last bu@@ lle@@ t I shot hit the small or@@ ange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target bur@@ st into fl@@ ames .
My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in Ar@@ abi@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n abu@@ h . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
They all seemed to get a really big lau@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
They thought they saw in me the same destruc@@ tion my father was capable of .
Those men would eventually be convic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a van filled with 1,@@ 500 pounds of explo@@ si@@ ves into the sub-@@ level par@@ king lot of the World Tra@@ de Center &apos;s North To@@ wer , ca@@ using an explo@@ sion that killed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1,000 others .
These were the men I looked up to .
These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle .
By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next town .
Be@@ ing the perpe@@ tual new face in class , I was frequ@@ ently the target of bu@@ lli@@ es .
I kept my identity a secret from my class@@ mates to avoid being tar@@ get@@ ed , but as it turns out , being the qui@@ et , ch@@ u@@ b@@ by new kid in class was more than enough am@@ mun@@ i@@ tion .
So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
For those reasons , my social skills were l@@ ac@@ king , to say the least , and growing up in a big@@ ot@@ ed hou@@ se@@ hold , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world .
I &apos;d been raised to jud@@ ge people based on ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary measu@@ re@@ ments , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challen@@ ged this way of thinking was during the 2000 pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tions .
Th@@ r@@ ough a college pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the National Y@@ outh Con@@ ven@@ tion in Phi@@ l@@ adel@@ phi@@ a .
My particular group &apos;s focus was on y@@ outh violence , and having been the victi@@ m of bu@@ ll@@ ying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
The members of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
One day toward the end of the conven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ ended was Je@@ wish .
Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural ani@@ mo@@ si@@ ty between the two of us .
I had never had a Je@@ wish friend before , and fran@@ kly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a barri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ moun@@ table .
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Bus@@ ch Gar@@ den@@ s , an am@@ us@@ ement park .
There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sorts of f@@ ai@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homo@@ sex@@ u@@ ality was a sin , and by exten@@ sion , that all gay people were a negative influence .
As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay perform@@ ers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kin@@ dest , least jud@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met .
Be@@ ing bu@@ lli@@ ed as a kid created a sense of empa@@ thy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very un@@ natur@@ ally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
Because of that feeling , I was able to contr@@ ast the ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with being jud@@ ged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
Then there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how . &quot; &quot; On a ni@@ ghtly basis , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t forced me to be intellec@@ tually honest with myself about my own big@@ otr@@ y and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orient@@ ation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desper@@ ate need of one .
In@@ spir@@ ation can often come from an un@@ expected place , and the fact that a Je@@ wish com@@ edi@@ an had done more to posi@@ tiv@@ ely influence my world@@ view than my own extre@@ mi@@ st father is not lost on me .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my world@@ view was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I live .
She looked at me with the w@@ ear@@ y eyes of someone who had experienced enough do@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ sm to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of ha@@ ting people . &quot;
In that inst@@ ant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hat@@ red inside of you .
Z@@ ak E@@ br@@ a@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and potenti@@ ally put myself in dan@@ ger ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I do it in the ho@@ pes that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ el@@ led to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subj@@ ected to this violent , in@@ toler@@ ant ide@@ ology , that I did not become f@@ an@@ ati@@ ci@@ zed .
Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the big@@ otr@@ y .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess acts and con@@ dem@@ n my father &apos;s actions .
And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that violence isn &apos;t inher@@ ent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
I am not my father .
I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be here .
I &apos;m hon@@ ored by the invit@@ ation , and th@@ anks .
I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I sus@@ p@@ ect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
First off , my b@@ ad@@ ge says I &apos;m an astron@@ om@@ er .
I would love to talk about my astron@@ o@@ my , but I sus@@ p@@ ect that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ ative trans@@ fer in non-@@ gr@@ ay atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ es and pol@@ ariz@@ ation of light in J@@ up@@ it@@ er &apos;s up@@ per atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shel@@ ter .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 198@@ 6 and 198@@ 7 , when a computer hac@@ ker is bre@@ aking into our systems over at La@@ wr@@ ence Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey L@@ ab@@ s .
And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Sovi@@ et K@@ G@@ B , and ste@@ aling information and selling it .
And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
I find computer security , fran@@ kly , to be kind of bor@@ ing .
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
A third time , it &apos;s just being a techni@@ ci@@ an .
I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvious stat@@ ements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Si@@ licon S@@ n@@ ake O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , n@@ or am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t bel@@ ong in schools .
I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
My idea is : no ! No !
G@@ et them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hun@@ g around a fourth grade class@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has lies in it as well .
H@@ aving said that , I out@@ lin@@ ed my talk about five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my th@@ u@@ mb was the future .
I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , because I &apos;ve got gr@@ ay hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of sil@@ ly for me to talk about the future .
In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technolog@@ ist , a scientist , a physici@@ st .
No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teacher .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teacher , ask an experienced one .
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I sus@@ p@@ ect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomen@@ ally good at text mess@@ aging and spend a huge amount of on-@@ screen time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?
Ch@@ ange is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
Because I love Mo@@ bi@@ us loo@@ ps . I not only love Mo@@ bi@@ us loo@@ ps , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les .
Right away , I hope that all of your eyes gl@@ az@@ e over .
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it .
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle whose inside is its outside .
It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-@@ orient@@ able .
It has wonderful properties .
If you take two Mo@@ bi@@ us loo@@ ps and se@@ w their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course st@@ ands for design .
Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the trade .
But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here .
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any flu@@ id at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al dimensions .
And because our universe is only three sp@@ ati@@ al dimensions , it can hold flu@@ i@@ ds .
So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
That was a month of my life .
But although I would love to talk about to@@ po@@ logy with you , I &apos;m not going to .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mom , who passed away last summer .
H@@ ad coll@@ ected photograph@@ s of me , as mothers will do .
Could somebody put this guy up ?
And I looked over her al@@ bu@@ m and she had coll@@ ected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 196@@ 9 , in front of a bunch of di@@ als .
And I looked at it , and said , oh my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the electr@@ onic music studi@@ o !
As a techni@@ ci@@ an , rep@@ air@@ ing and main@@ tain@@ ing the electr@@ onic music studi@@ o at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o . And w@@ ow !
W@@ ay back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
And it sent me back .
So@@ on after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
This guy over here of course is me .
This man is Robert Mo@@ o@@ g , the invent@@ or of the Mo@@ o@@ g syn@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ er , who passed away this past Au@@ g@@ ust .
Robert Mo@@ o@@ g was a gener@@ ous , kind person , extraordin@@ arily compe@@ t@@ ent engineer .
A mu@@ sici@@ an who took time from his life to teach me , a so@@ pho@@ more , a fres@@ h@@ man at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o .
He &apos;d come up from T@@ ru@@ man@@ s@@ bur@@ g to teach me not just about the Mo@@ o@@ g syn@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ er , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 196@@ 9 , 70 , 7@@ 1 .
We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
Don &apos;t get caught up in electr@@ onic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; M@@ entor@@ ing me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
He wrote a letter of recom@@ men@@ dation for me to get into graduate school .
In the background , my bic@@ y@@ cle .
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
Bo@@ b Mo@@ o@@ g came by and ha@@ ul@@ ed a whole pi@@ le of equipment to show Gre@@ g F@@ lin@@ t and I things about this .
We sat around talking about F@@ ou@@ ri@@ er transform@@ s , B@@ ess@@ el func@@ tions , mo@@ dul@@ ation trans@@ fer func@@ tions , stuff like this .
Bo@@ b &apos;s pas@@ sing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
Any@@ one who &apos;s a mu@@ sici@@ an has been prof@@ oun@@ dly influ@@ enced by Robert Mo@@ o@@ g .
( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a dist@@ or@@ ted s@@ ine wave , almost a tri@@ angu@@ lar wave upon this He@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ P@@ ack@@ ard os@@ ci@@ llo@@ s@@ cope .
Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
Ki@@ ds . Ki@@ ds is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
So I think loc@@ ally and I act loc@@ ally .
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very loc@@ ally .
So Ph@@ .@@ D. this , and degree there , and the y@@ ad@@ da y@@ ad@@ da .
I was talking about this stuff to some scho@@ ol@@ teachers about a year ago .
And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught under@@ graduate clas@@ ses . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
Pu@@ t your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade science four days a week .
Not just showing up every now and then .
No , no , no , no , no . I take atten@@ dance .
I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not cl@@ aps .
I str@@ ong@@ ly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
Not just show up to class every now and then .
T@@ each a soli@@ d week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-@@ quar@@ ters time , but good enough .
One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you colle@@ ge@@ -@@ level physics .
No cal@@ cu@@ lus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
You won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .
But you will need to know ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ bra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
N@@ one of this open@@ -@@ to-@@ c@@ hap@@ ter@@ -@@ se@@ ven@@ -@@ and-@@ do@@ -@@ all@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ od@@ d-@@ problem@@ -@@ sets .
We &apos;re going to be doing genu@@ ine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
( H@@ igh@@ -@@ pit@@ ched t@@ one ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the len@@ s , and one of the things we used a len@@ s for was to measure the speed of light .
My students in El C@@ erri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up os@@ ci@@ llo@@ s@@ cope — measu@@ red the speed of light .
We were off by 25 percent . How many ei@@ gh@@ th grad@@ ers do you know of who have measu@@ red the speed of light ?
In addition to that , we &apos;ve measu@@ red the speed of sound .
I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to im@@ pose upon the po@@ wers that be , and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
But mean@@ while , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bo@@ un@@ ce sound off something and look at the echo .
But , probably — one of my students , Ari@@ el &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equ@@ ation ? &quot;
And all of you know the wave equ@@ ation is the frequ@@ ency times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of any wave ...
is a const@@ ant . When the frequ@@ ency goes up , the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th goes up , frequ@@ ency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pit@@ ch goes up , things get closer , pit@@ ch goes down , things stre@@ t@@ ch out .
Right ? This is simple physics .
All of you know this from ei@@ gh@@ th grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multi@@ ply the frequ@@ ency times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound or light , you get a const@@ ant .
And that const@@ ant is the speed of sound .
So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequ@@ ency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
I &apos;ve got a frequ@@ ency coun@@ ter right here .
S@@ et it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
Now , so I know the frequ@@ ency .
It &apos;s 1.@@ 7@@ 6 kilo@@ her@@ t@@ z . I measure its w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th .
All I need now is to fli@@ p on another be@@ am , and the bottom be@@ am is me talking , right ?
So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spir@@ al .
The s@@ lin@@ ky moves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the wave , coming out this way .
Those of you who are physici@@ sts , I hear you ro@@ lling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
From here to here is the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound .
So , I &apos;ll put a meas@@ uring tap@@ e here , meas@@ uring tap@@ e here , move it back over to here .
I &apos;ve moved the micro@@ phone 20 c@@ enti@@ meters .
0@@ .@@ 2 meters from here , back to here , 20 c@@ enti@@ meters .
OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. El@@ mo .
And we &apos;ll say the frequ@@ ency is 1.@@ 7@@ 6 kilo@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 17@@ 60 .
The w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th was 0@@ .@@ 2 meters .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.@@ 7@@ 6 times 0@@ .@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 5@@ 2 meters per second .
If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 4@@ 3 .
But , here with k@@ lu@@ d@@ g@@ y material , and l@@ ous@@ y drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . P@@ ret@@ ty good .
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
It was 197@@ 1 , the Vi@@ et@@ n@@ am War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : L@@ an@@ da@@ u , Li@@ p@@ sch@@ it@@ z , Res@@ n@@ ick and H@@ al@@ li@@ day .
I &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . A ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ pus .
There &apos;s a ri@@ ot ! Hey , El@@ mo &apos;s done : off .
There &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on cam@@ pus , and the police are cha@@ sing me , right ?
I &apos;m walking across cam@@ pus . Co@@ p comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Pu@@ lls out a gun . Go@@ es bo@@ om !
And a te@@ ar gas can@@ ister the size of a P@@ ep@@ si can goes by my head . W@@ ho@@ os@@ h !
I get a bre@@ ath of te@@ ar gas and I can &apos;t brea@@ the .
This co@@ p comes after me with a ri@@ f@@ le .
He wants to cl@@ un@@ k me over the head !
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across cam@@ pus quick as I can . I duc@@ k into H@@ ay@@ es H@@ all .
It &apos;s one of these bel@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ wer buildings .
The co@@ p &apos;s cha@@ sing me .
Cha@@ sing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
Cha@@ ses me into this room .
The entr@@ anc@@ e@@ way to the b@@ ell to@@ wer .
I sl@@ am the door behind me , cli@@ mb up , go past this place where I see a pen@@ du@@ lum tic@@ king .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square ro@@ ot of the leng@@ th is propor@@ tional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climb@@ ing up , go back .
I go to a place where a dow@@ el sp@@ li@@ ts off .
There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
The time &apos;s going back@@ wards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of L@@ or@@ en@@ z contr@@ actions and E@@ inste@@ ini@@ an relativ@@ ity .
I cli@@ mb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you cli@@ mb up this wo@@ o@@ den lad@@ der .
I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ po@@ la .
A do@@ me , one of these ten@@ -@@ foot do@@ mes .
I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the co@@ ps bas@@ h@@ ing students &apos; heads , sho@@ oting te@@ ar gas , and watching students thro@@ wing br@@ icks .
And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
N@@ am@@ ely , that when they cas@@ t bel@@ ls , they write ins@@ crip@@ tions on them .
So , I wi@@ pe the pi@@ geon man@@ ure off one of the bel@@ ls , and I look at it .
I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words ins@@ cri@@ bed upon the H@@ ay@@ es H@@ all to@@ wer bel@@ ls : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
In this light , may science and religion en@@ de@@ av@@ or here for the ste@@ ady evolution of man@@ kind , from dar@@ k@@ ness to light , from n@@ arro@@ w@@ ness to broad@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , from pre@@ judi@@ ce to toler@@ ance .
It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
And as I stood on the front por@@ ch fu@@ m@@ bling in my po@@ ck@@ ets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them .
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other do@@ ors and win@@ dows , and they were loc@@ ked ti@@ ght .
So , desper@@ ate and fre@@ ez@@ ing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the bas@@ ement window , clear@@ ed out the shar@@ ds of glass , I cra@@ w@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ board and tap@@ ed it up over the opening , figur@@ ing that in the morning , on the way to the air@@ port , I could call my contr@@ actor and ask him to fix it .
This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a mid@@ d@@ le-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night loc@@ k@@ s@@ mit@@ h , so I figured , under the circum@@ st@@ ances , I was coming out even .
It rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol that rais@@ es your heart rate , it mo@@ dul@@ ates ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine levels and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking .
( Laughter ) And I started wonder@@ ing , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
Or at least if bad things happen , will mini@@ mi@@ ze the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of it being a total cat@@ astr@@ op@@ he .
So I started thinking about that , but my thoughts didn &apos;t cr@@ yst@@ al@@ li@@ ze until about a month later .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psycho@@ logist G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
Now , you all know what the post@@ mor@@ te@@ m is .
Wh@@ enever there &apos;s a dis@@ aster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
Well , in the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ an@@ ny expla@@ ined , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to mini@@ mi@@ ze the damage .
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
A@@ round the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a place for things that are easily lost .
Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our sp@@ ati@@ al memory works .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the loc@@ ations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fru@@ it trees , where the friend@@ ly and enem@@ y tri@@ bes live .
The hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pus is the part of the brain that in London tax@@ ic@@ a@@ b dri@@ vers becomes en@@ lar@@ ged .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows s@@ qui@@ r@@ rel@@ s to find their nu@@ ts .
And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the ol@@ factory sense of the s@@ qui@@ r@@ rel@@ s , and they could still find their nu@@ ts .
They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pus , this ex@@ quisi@@ tely evolved mechan@@ ism in the brain for finding things .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
So this is why we lose car keys and reading gl@@ as@@ ses and pass@@ ports .
So in the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a spot for your keys — a ho@@ ok by the door , maybe a de@@ cor@@ ative bo@@ w@@ l .
For your pass@@ port , a particular dra@@ wer .
For your reading gl@@ as@@ ses , a particular table .
If you desig@@ n@@ ate a spot and you &apos;re s@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
What about travel ?
Now these are some rather obvious things .
Rem@@ ember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol .
Cor@@ ti@@ sol is toxi@@ c , and it causes cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking .
So part of the practice of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
And there &apos;s perhaps no more str@@ ess@@ ful a situation than when you &apos;re confron@@ ted with a medical decision to make .
And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
But this st@@ ands as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medical deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making , and indeed for financial deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making , and social deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational ass@@ ess@@ ment of the facts .
So sup@@ pose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or under@@ go a surgery or any medical proced@@ ure before one person is helped .
And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy stati@@ stic is that ?
The number should be one .
My doctor wouldn &apos;t pres@@ cri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
We haven &apos;t figured out the under@@ lying mechan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line esti@@ mates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number needed to treat for the most wid@@ ely pres@@ cri@@ bed stati@@ n , what do you sup@@ pose it is ?
This is ac@@ cording to research by research practi@@ tion@@ ers J@@ ero@@ me Gro@@ op@@ man and P@@ am@@ ela H@@ art@@ z@@ band , independ@@ ently confir@@ med by B@@ loo@@ m@@ ber@@ g@@ .@@ com@@ .
I ran through the numbers myself .
Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the stati@@ n or not .
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
For the most wid@@ ely perform@@ ed surgery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mov@@ al of the pro@@ state for cancer , the number needed to treat is 4@@ 9 .
That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 surg@@ eries are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
And the side effects in that case occu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
They inclu@@ de im@@ poten@@ ce , er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le dy@@ s@@ function , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ tal t@@ earing , f@@ ec@@ al in@@ contin@@ ence .
And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
So the idea of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to manufac@@ ture all of this on the spot .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
Rem@@ ember , our brain under stress rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shu@@ t down .
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situ@@ ations .
I think the important point here is recogni@@ zing that all of us are fla@@ wed .
We all are going to fail now and then .
The idea is to think ahead to what those fail@@ ures might be , to put systems in place that will help mini@@ mi@@ ze the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
And I have to ad@@ mit , I still have pi@@ les of ma@@ il that haven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and pi@@ les of em@@ ails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a grad@@ ual process , and I &apos;m getting there .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Good morning !
Are you aw@@ ake ?
They took my name ta@@ g , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the ta@@ g in Ar@@ abi@@ c ?
Any@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem .
Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , or@@ der@@ ing food .
So I looked at the wa@@ it@@ er and said , &quot; Do you have a men@@ u ( Ar@@ abi@@ c ) ? &quot;
He looked at me str@@ ang@@ ely , thinking that he mis@@ heard .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sor@@ ry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The men@@ u ( Ar@@ abi@@ c ) , please . &quot; &quot; He re@@ pli@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pron@@ unci@@ ation correc@@ t ?
&quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ it@@ er .
He was dis@@ gust@@ ed when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in Ar@@ abi@@ c ?
Two words made a Le@@ ban@@ ese young man jud@@ ge a girl as being back@@ ward and ignor@@ ant .
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It made me ma@@ d .
It definitely hur@@ ts !
I &apos;m den@@ i@@ ed the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
Where could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they invol@@ un@@ t@@ arily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civiliz@@ ed .
Sh@@ ould I forget all my culture , thoughts , intel@@ l@@ ect and all my mem@@ ories ?
Chi@@ ld@@ hood stories might be the best mem@@ ories we have of the war !
Sh@@ ould I forget everything I learned in Ar@@ abi@@ c , just to con@@ form ?
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
Des@@ pi@@ te all that , I tried to understand him .
I didn &apos;t want to jud@@ ge him with the same cru@@ el@@ ty that he jud@@ ged me .
The Ar@@ abi@@ c language doesn &apos;t satis@@ fy today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universi@@ ties , a language we use in the work@@ place , a language we rely on if we were to per@@ form an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ port .
If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our clo@@ th@@ es .
Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Ar@@ abi@@ c . Where are we to do so ?
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Ar@@ abi@@ c is the mother ton@@ gue .
Res@@ ear@@ ch says that ma@@ st@@ ery of other languages dem@@ ands ma@@ st@@ ery of the mother ton@@ gue .
M@@ ast@@ ery of the mother ton@@ gue is a pr@@ er@@ equi@@ site for creative expres@@ sion in other languages .
How ?
Gi@@ br@@ an K@@ h@@ ali@@ l Gi@@ br@@ an , when he first started writing , he used Ar@@ abi@@ c .
All his ideas , imagination and philosoph@@ y were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , sm@@ el@@ ling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writ@@ ings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Moun@@ t Le@@ ban@@ on .
So , this is an example no one can argue with .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Ger@@ man@@ s , French , Jap@@ an@@ ese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
That &apos;s why they leg@@ is@@ late to protect their language .
They make it sac@@ red .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
Do we know better than them ?
All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t re@@ ached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civiliz@@ ed world .
Coun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Tur@@ key , Mal@@ ay@@ sia and others , they car@@ ried their language with them as they were climb@@ ing the lad@@ der , prot@@ ected it like a di@@ am@@ ond .
They kept it close to them .
Because if you get any product from Tur@@ key or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not lab@@ el@@ ed in Tur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They &apos;d go back to being consu@@ mers , clu@@ eless consu@@ mers , like we are most of the time .
So , in order for them to innov@@ ate and produce , they had to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Fre@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , independ@@ ence ( Ar@@ abi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; what does this re@@ mind you of ?
It doesn &apos;t ring a b@@ ell , does it ?
R@@ eg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why .
L@@ angu@@ age isn &apos;t just for conver@@ sing , just words coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths .
L@@ angu@@ age repres@@ ents specific st@@ ages in our lives , and termin@@ ology that is lin@@ ked to our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Fre@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , independ@@ ence , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific histor@@ ical period .
L@@ angu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
It &apos;s an idea inside that rel@@ ates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
What is our intel@@ l@@ ect ?
How do you say whether this guy underst@@ ands or not ?
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Fre@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , independ@@ ence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ ain .
The idea is that these expres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a specific thing .
I have a fran@@ co@@ phone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
I asked her once how things were going .
She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to trans@@ late the meaning of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
He was puzz@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cru@@ el ?
It made us feel that she &apos;s un@@ able to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listen@@ s to F@@ ai@@ ru@@ z with me , and one night , I tried to trans@@ late for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to F@@ ai@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to trans@@ late this for him : &quot; From them I exten@@ ded my hands and st@@ ole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you bel@@ ong to them , I re@@ turned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
Tr@@ ans@@ late that for me .
( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Ar@@ abi@@ c language ?
We turned this into a concer@@ n of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preser@@ ve the Ar@@ abi@@ c language .
Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?
For@@ get about this head@@ ac@@ he and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The campaign to preser@@ ve Ar@@ abi@@ c launched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you re@@ ply from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adop@@ t this st@@ yle because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Ar@@ abi@@ c language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that refl@@ ects our dreams , aspir@@ ations and da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day life .
In a way that dres@@ ses like us and thinks like we do .
So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you re@@ ply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
Some@@ thing very easy , yet creative and persu@@ asi@@ ve .
After that , we launched another campaign with sc@@ enes of letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surro@@ unded by black and yellow tap@@ e with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
Why ? S@@ eri@@ ously , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
We &apos;d have to find an existence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civiliz@@ ed .
After that we rele@@ ased photos of guys and girls wearing the Ar@@ abi@@ c letter .
Ph@@ ot@@ os of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adop@@ t the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s n@@ ic@@ er and mat@@ ches the reality better .
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( L@@ au@@ gh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any auth@@ ority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
Cre@@ ativ@@ ity is the idea .
So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a ro@@ cket and so on , we can be creative .
At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
Cre@@ ativ@@ ity in your mother ton@@ gue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a no@@ vel or produce a short film .
A single no@@ vel could make us global again .
It could bring the Ar@@ abi@@ c language back to being number one .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solution .
In conclu@@ sion , what can you do today ?
Now , tw@@ e@@ ets , who &apos;s tw@@ e@@ eting ?
Please , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has finished , either Ar@@ abi@@ c , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Ar@@ abi@@ c with L@@ ati@@ n characters mi@@ xed with numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a dis@@ aster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be ent@@ ering a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not here today to conv@@ ince each other .
We &apos;re here to bring attention to the neces@@ si@@ ty of preser@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a secret .
A baby first identi@@ fi@@ es its father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , hon@@ ey ( Ar@@ abi@@ c ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , hon@@ ey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the super@@ market , I promise my daughter No@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Ar@@ abi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ c@@ i , M@@ am@@ an , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cr@@ in@@ ge . ( Applause )
S@@ ust@@ ain@@ ability repres@@ ents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
I want to know how I impact them .
I want to know how they impact me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bo@@ un@@ ty for their living .
Un@@ der@@ standing all of this en@@ ables us to shift our percep@@ tion of se@@ af@@ ood away from a com@@ modi@@ ty to an opportunity to rest@@ ore our ecos@@ y@@ stem .
It allows for us to celebr@@ ate the se@@ af@@ ood that we &apos;re also so fortun@@ ate to eat .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it rest@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
Where sustain@@ ability is the capacity to en@@ dur@@ e and main@@ tain , rest@@ or@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and progress .
R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood allows for an evol@@ ving and dynamic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relationship with the ocean as a resour@@ ce , sugg@@ esting that we engage to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to encour@@ age its resili@@ ency .
It is a more hope@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
Wal@@ let gu@@ ides — standard issue by lots in the mar@@ ine conserv@@ ation world — are very hand@@ y ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
Gre@@ en , yellow and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ af@@ ood species .
The associ@@ ation is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
We can &apos;t sust@@ ain this without the measure of our success really changing the f@@ ate of the species in the yellow and the red .
But what if we eat only in the green list ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le-@@ caught yel@@ low@@ fin t@@ una here — comes from sustainable st@@ oc@@ ks .
Po@@ le caught — no b@@ y@@ catch .
Great for fish@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . Su@@ p@@ port@@ ing local economi@@ es .
But it &apos;s a li@@ on of the sea . It &apos;s a top pre@@ dat@@ or .
What &apos;s the context of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sitting down in a ste@@ ak@@ house to a 16@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any fav@@ ors .
The point is that we have to have a context , a g@@ au@@ ge for our actions in all this .
Ex@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ants and min@@ er@@ als — heart healthy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
Well folks , we have a protein problem .
We have lost this sen@@ sibility when it regar@@ ds our food , and we are paying a cost .
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost ben@@ e@@ ath the waves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social accep@@ tan@@ ce of exp@@ anding w@@ ai@@ st@@ lines .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster prof@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of rest@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood is that it really takes into account our needs .
R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood might best be represent@@ ed not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ p@@ per , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fish@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en Gi@@ ant .
V@@ eg@@ et@@ ables : they might yet save the oceans .
Sy@@ l@@ via li@@ kes to say that blue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to resp@@ ect@@ fully sub@@ mit that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new blue .
We must continue to eat the best se@@ af@@ ood possible , if at all .
But we also must eat it with a ton of veget@@ ables .
The best part about rest@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ co and lem@@ on w@@ ed@@ ges .
It comes in a fi@@ ve-@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a bre@@ aded with Di@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ iled bre@@ ad@@ cru@@ mb@@ s and a ste@@ aming pi@@ le of p@@ ec@@ an qu@@ in@@ o@@ a pi@@ la@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , gri@@ lled bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so soft and swe@@ et and char@@ red and smo@@ ky on the outside with just a h@@ int of chil@@ i fla@@ ke .
W@@ ho@@ o@@ o !
This is an easy sell .
And the best part is all of those ingre@@ di@@ ents are available to every family at the neighborhood Wal@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ ami@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is campaig@@ ning to save America from the way we eat .
Sy@@ l@@ via is campaig@@ ning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
There &apos;s a pattern here .
For@@ get nuclear ho@@ loc@@ a@@ ust ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to worry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ aged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to han@@ dic@@ ap ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
S@@ ust@@ ain@@ ability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
Dan Bar@@ ber and Ali@@ ce Wat@@ ers are leading passion@@ ately the green food De@@ li@@ cious R@@ evolution .
But green fo@@ ods often represent a way for us to dis@@ regar@@ d the responsibility as e@@ at@@ ers .
Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with dis@@ regar@@ d on the pl@@ ate .
We have eco@@ -@@ friend@@ ly sh@@ ri@@ mp .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any eco@@ -@@ friend@@ ly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ eat sh@@ ri@@ mp bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ healthy dinner is a very important part of rest@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
Whi@@ le we try to manage dec@@ lin@@ ing mar@@ ine popul@@ ations , the media &apos;s recom@@ men@@ ding increas@@ ed consumption of se@@ af@@ ood .
Stu@@ dies say that tens of thousands of American grand@@ mothers , grand@@ fa@@ thers , mothers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ ood .
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not willing to pass up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ ood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
As a che@@ f , I realize the easi@@ est thing for me to do is reduce the por@@ tion si@@ zes on my pl@@ ate .
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
People started bu@@ ying appe@@ tiz@@ ers and sal@@ ads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entre@@ es alone .
People spent more time eng@@ aging in their me@@ als , eng@@ aging with each other over their me@@ als .
People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
They got more cal@@ ories over the course of a diversi@@ fied me@@ al .
They got heal@@ thi@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
En@@ viron@@ mental consider@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing mo@@ und of consider@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time .
One of the other things we did was begin to diversi@@ fy the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common .
S@@ hel@@ l@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , oy@@ sters , cl@@ ams , ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a , cha@@ r — these were the common species .
We were direc@@ ting ta@@ st@@ es towards more resili@@ ence , more rest@@ or@@ ative op@@ tions .
This is what we need to favor .
This is what the green list says .
But this is also how we can actually begin to rest@@ ore our environment .
But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those fashi@@ on@@ able species , that green list t@@ una that I was talking about earlier ?
Well , if you must , I have a reci@@ pe for you .
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
Star@@ t with a 16@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . Cu@@ t it into four por@@ tions .
Pu@@ t it on four pl@@ ates .
M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with veget@@ ables and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of Bur@@ gun@@ dy you have , light the c@@ and@@ les and celebr@@ ate it .
C@@ el@@ ebr@@ ate the opportunity you have to eat this .
In@@ vi@@ te your friends and neighb@@ ors over and repe@@ at once a year , maybe .
I expect a lot from food .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I expect that producing ingre@@ di@@ ents , prepar@@ ing dis@@ h@@ es and eating me@@ als is all part of the commun@@ i@@ on of human interest@@ s .
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic co@@ ok .
And he taught me very early on about the privile@@ ge that eating repres@@ ents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my childhood .
They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of protein ser@@ ved with copi@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ties of veget@@ ables and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , usually r@@ ice .
This is still how I larg@@ ely eat today .
I get sick when I go to ste@@ ak@@ houses .
I get the meat swe@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a han@@ go@@ ver from protein .
It &apos;s dis@@ gust@@ ing .
But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the un@@ fortun@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ vering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
E@@ at your veget@@ ables .
It &apos;s pretty strai@@ ght@@ forward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ esome ingre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body .
For joy , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ tter and sal@@ t and sex@@ y things that make things tas@@ te less like pen@@ ance .
For family , I &apos;m looking for reci@@ pes that genu@@ fl@@ ect to my own personal histori@@ es .
For community though , we start at the very beginning .
There &apos;s no escap@@ ing the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to mini@@ mi@@ ze it .
We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ograph@@ y of the commun@@ i@@ on we call dinner .
So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebr@@ ate , we can begin to rest@@ ore .
We need to sav@@ or veget@@ ables .
We need to sav@@ or smaller por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ ood .
And we need to save dinner .
Thank you .

H@@ i . I am an archit@@ ect .
I am the only archit@@ ect in the world making buildings out of paper like this car@@ d@@ board tu@@ be , and this exhibi@@ tion is the first one I did using paper tu@@ bes .
198@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about eco@@ logical issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure .
It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stron@@ ger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of .
Then I built the tempor@@ ary structure , 199@@ 0 .
This is the first tempor@@ ary building made out of paper .
There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ bes , di@@ ame@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; c@@ enti@@ meters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ bes with a di@@ ame@@ ter of 1@@ 20 c@@ enti@@ meters , or four feet , wide .
As you see it in the photo , inside is the toi@@ let .
In case you &apos;re finished with toi@@ let paper , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
Y@@ ear 2000 , there was a big ex@@ po in Germany .
I was asked to design the building , because the them@@ e of the ex@@ po was environmental issues .
So I was ch@@ os@@ en to build the pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on out of paper tu@@ bes , recy@@ cl@@ able paper .
My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s complet@@ ed .
My goal was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be re@@ used or recy@@ cl@@ ed .
After , the building was recy@@ cl@@ ed .
So that was the goal of my design .
Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in Fr@@ ance in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
Because I was so poor , I wanted to r@@ ent an office in Par@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Par@@ is to build our office on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in Par@@ is by ourselves .
So we brought the paper tu@@ bes and the wo@@ o@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to complete the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long office .
We st@@ ayed there for six years without paying any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a tic@@ ket to see me .
That was the problem .
Then I complet@@ ed the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in M@@ et@@ z .
It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big mon@@ u@@ ment for the government .
But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ pointed at my profes@@ sion as an archit@@ ect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privi@@ leg@@ ed people , rich people , government , devel@@ oper@@ s .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
So they hi@@ re us to visu@@ alize their power and money by making mon@@ u@@ mental architecture .
That is our profes@@ sion , even histor@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
So I was very dis@@ ap@@ pointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural dis@@ ast@@ ers .
But I must say they are no longer natural dis@@ ast@@ ers .
For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ akes never kill people , but collap@@ se of the buildings kill people .
That &apos;s the responsibility of archit@@ ects .
Then people need some tempor@@ ary hou@@ sing , but there are no archit@@ ects working there because we are too bus@@ y working for privi@@ leg@@ ed people .
So I thought , even as archit@@ ects , we can be involved in the re@@ construction of tempor@@ ary hou@@ sing .
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in dis@@ aster areas .
199@@ 4 , there was a big dis@@ aster in R@@ w@@ anda , Africa .
Two tri@@ bes , Hu@@ tu and Tu@@ t@@ si , f@@ ought each other .
Over two million people became refuge@@ es .
But I was so surprised to see the shel@@ ter , refuge@@ e cam@@ p organized by the U.@@ N@@ .
They &apos;re so poor , and they are fre@@ ez@@ ing with blan@@ k@@ ets during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ ason , In the shel@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a plastic she@@ et , and the refuge@@ es had to cut the trees , and just like this .
But over two million people cut trees .
It just became big , heavy de@@ for@@ est@@ ation and an environmental problem .
That is why they started provi@@ ding alu@@ minu@@ m pi@@ pes , alu@@ minu@@ m barr@@ acks .
Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cu@@ tting trees again .
So I pro@@ posed my idea to improve the situation using these recy@@ cl@@ ed paper tu@@ bes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per un@@ it .
We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a monit@@ or@@ ing test for the dur@@ ability and mo@@ ist@@ ure and ter@@ mites , so on .
And then , year after@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in Ko@@ be , Japan , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake .
N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were killed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ ata distr@@ ic@@ t , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fire after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake .
And also I found out there &apos;s many Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese refuge@@ es suffering and gather@@ ing at a C@@ ath@@ o@@ lic ch@@ urch — all the building was totally destro@@ yed .
So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ ests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ urch out of paper tu@@ bes ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
After a fire , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tr@@ usted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started com@@ mu@@ ting to Ko@@ be , and I met the society of Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people .
They were living like this with very poor plastic she@@ ets in the park .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I raised — did fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing .
I made a paper tu@@ be shel@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ li@@ sh , I used be@@ er cr@@ ates as a foundation .
I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ pose , because at that time , the As@@ ah@@ i be@@ er company made their plastic be@@ er cr@@ ates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tu@@ bes .
The color coordin@@ ation is very important .
And also I still remember , we were exp@@ ecting to have a be@@ er inside the plastic be@@ er c@@ rate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting .
So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the shel@@ ters .
Fin@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tr@@ usted me to re@@ build .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the ch@@ urch .
It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it st@@ ayed there 10 years because people loved it .
Then , in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ posed to don@@ ate this ch@@ urch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we sent them over to be built by volunte@@ er people .
It st@@ ayed there in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as a perman@@ ent ch@@ urch even now .
So this building became a perman@@ ent building .
Then I wonder , what is a perman@@ ent and what is a tempor@@ ary building ?
Even a building made in paper can be perman@@ ent as long as people love it .
Even a concre@@ te building can be very tempor@@ ary if that is made to make money .
In 199@@ 9 , in Tur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local material to build a shel@@ ter .
2001 , in West India , I built also a shel@@ ter .
In 2004 , in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ ka , after the Su@@ ma@@ tra ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ sun@@ ami , I re@@ built Isl@@ amic fish@@ er@@ men &apos;s vill@@ ages .
And in 2008 , in Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u , S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an area in China , nearly 7@@ 0,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destro@@ yed because of the corruption between the auth@@ ority and the contr@@ actor .
I was asked to re@@ build the tempor@@ ary ch@@ urch .
I brought my Jap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Chinese students .
In one month , we complet@@ ed nine class@@ rooms , over 500 square meters .
It &apos;s still used , even after the current ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China .
In 2009 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qui@@ la , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake .
And this is a very interesting photo : form@@ er Pri@@ me Min@@ ister Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and Jap@@ an@@ ese form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er Pri@@ me Min@@ ister Mr. A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the prime min@@ ister ever year .
And they are very kind , af@@ for@@ ding my model .
I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a tempor@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qui@@ la is very famous for music and all the concer@@ t h@@ alls were destro@@ yed , so mu@@ sici@@ ans were moving out .
So I pro@@ posed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tempor@@ ary audi@@ tori@@ um .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
Mr. Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i brought G@@ 8 sum@@ mit , and our form@@ er prime min@@ ister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million e@@ ur@@ os from the Jap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this tempor@@ ary audi@@ tori@@ um .
Y@@ ear 2010 in Hait@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to S@@ anto Do@@ min@@ go , n@@ ex@@ t-@@ door country , to drive six hours to get to Hait@@ i with the local students in S@@ anto Do@@ min@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of shel@@ ter out of local paper tu@@ bes .
This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in nor@@ thern Japan .
After the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ sun@@ ami , people had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ ym@@ n@@ asi@@ um .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suf@@ fer ment@@ ally and physic@@ ally .
So we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the student volunte@@ ers with paper tu@@ bes , just a very simple shel@@ ter out of the tu@@ be frame and the cur@@ tain .
However , some of the facili@@ ty auth@@ ority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at area to build standard government sing@@ le-@@ story hou@@ sing like this one .
Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the tempor@@ ary hou@@ sing , so den@@ se and so mess@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is le@@ aking , so I thought , we have to make multi@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
So I pro@@ posed to the mayor while I was making parti@@ tions .
Fin@@ ally I met a very nice mayor in On@@ ag@@ aw@@ a village in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build three-@@ story hou@@ sing on bas@@ e@@ ball &#91; fields &#93; .
I used the shi@@ pping con@@ tain@@ er and also the students helped us to make all the building fur@@ n@@ it@@ ure to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Christ@@ ch@@ urch .
Ab@@ out 20 days before the Jap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many Jap@@ an@@ ese students were also killed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al of the city , the sym@@ bol of Christ@@ ch@@ urch , was totally destro@@ yed .
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tempor@@ ary ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al .
So this is under construction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ u@@ ments that are bel@@ o@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psycho@@ logists , would have said that this baby was ir@@ rational , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ centr@@ ic — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture .
So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you just one example of this .
One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
After all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ dest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
And maybe the har@@ dest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
Any@@ one who &apos;s followed politics can testi@@ fy to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
B@@ abies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gue about poni@@ es and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
What we did — B@@ et@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ac@@ hol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of deli@@ cious gol@@ d@@ fish cr@@ ac@@ kers .
Now all of the babies , even in Ber@@ k@@ ley , like the cr@@ ac@@ kers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
( Laughter ) But then what B@@ et@@ ty did was to take a little tas@@ te of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
So half the time , she acted as if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ac@@ kers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a baby and any other san@@ e person .
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ mm , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
I ta@@ st@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ mm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ac@@ kers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck , cr@@ ac@@ kers .
I ta@@ st@@ ed the cr@@ ac@@ kers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies , just bar@@ ely walking and talking , would give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ac@@ kers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
On the other hand , 15 mon@@ th-@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she acted as if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers , what they thought everybody must like .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more remark@@ ably though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th-@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this sugg@@ ests that these 18 mon@@ th-@@ ol@@ ds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstr@@ ated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at babies superfici@@ ally , they seem pretty us@@ eless .
And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than us@@ eless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzz@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of us@@ eless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mates , but also including other mam@@ m@@ als , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ an@@ gar@@ o@@ os and wom@@ bat@@ s , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ birds for this idea are the birds up there .
On one side is a New Cal@@ ed@@ oni@@ an c@@ row .
And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ ven@@ s , ro@@ o@@ ks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimp@@ anz@@ ees in some resp@@ ects .
And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our friend the dom@@ esti@@ c chic@@ ken .
And ch@@ ick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ keys are basically as du@@ mb as du@@ m@@ ps .
So they &apos;re very , very good at p@@ ec@@ king for gr@@ ain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
Well it turns out that the babies , the New Cal@@ ed@@ oni@@ an c@@ row babies , are fle@@ d@@ gl@@ ings .
They depen@@ d on their mo@@ ms to drop wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
Wh@@ er@@ eas the ch@@ ick@@ ens are actually mat@@ ure within a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the cover of Sci@@ ence and the ch@@ ick@@ ens end up in the sou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of explan@@ ation could we have for this ?
Well some animals , like the chic@@ ken , seem to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well .
So they seem to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to p@@ ec@@ king gr@@ ain in one environment .
O@@ ther creatures , like the cro@@ ws , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environ@@ ments .
And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the cro@@ ws .
We have bigger brains rel@@ ative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
We &apos;re smar@@ ter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environ@@ ments , we migr@@ ated to cover the world and even go to ou@@ ter space .
And our babies and children are depend@@ ent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths .
All right , why would we see this cor@@ rel@@ ation ?
Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big dis@@ advantage .
And that one big dis@@ advantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess .
So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ st@@ o@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A sl@@ ing@@ shot or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
You want to know all that before the ma@@ st@@ od@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evolu@@ tions seems to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of divi@@ sion of labor .
So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely prot@@ ected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development divi@@ sion of the human species .
So they &apos;re the prot@@ ected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like def@@ ective grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental stage of the same species — kind of like cat@@ er@@ pi@@ ll@@ ars and bu@@ tter@@ flies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant bu@@ tter@@ flies who are fli@@ tting around the gar@@ den and explor@@ ing , and we &apos;re the cat@@ er@@ pi@@ ll@@ ars who are in@@ ching along our n@@ arro@@ w , grow@@ nu@@ p , adult path .
If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechan@@ is@@ ms .
And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
And it all depen@@ ds on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Thomas B@@ ay@@ es , who was a stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and mathemati@@ ci@@ an in the 18@@ th century .
And essentially what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provide a mathematical way using prob@@ ability theory to character@@ ize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypo@@ thesis that they think might be likely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypo@@ thesis .
Then they test that new hypo@@ thesis and so on and so forth .
And what B@@ ay@@ es showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
And some 10 years ago , I sugg@@ ested that babies might be doing the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calcul@@ ations with condi@@ tional prob@@ abilities that they &apos;re revis@@ ing to figure out how the world works .
All right , now that might seem like an even tall@@ er order to actually demonstr@@ ate .
Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ ket D@@ et@@ ector .
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
Let me men@@ tion just one that we did with Tu@@ mar K@@ ush@@ ner , my student .
If I showed you this det@@ ector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the det@@ ector go would be to put a block on top of the det@@ ector .
But actually , this det@@ ector works in a bit of a strange way .
Because if you wave a block over the top of the det@@ ector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the det@@ ector will actually activ@@ ate two out of three times .
Wh@@ er@@ eas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the det@@ ector , it will only activ@@ ate two out of six times .
So the un@@ likely hypo@@ thesis actually has stron@@ ger evidence .
It looks as if the w@@ aving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
So we did just this ; we gave four year-@@ ol@@ ds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
And sure enough , the four year-@@ ol@@ ds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the det@@ ector .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calcul@@ ations that will give them a condi@@ tional prob@@ ability measure .
And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypo@@ thesis about the world , that seems very un@@ likely to begin with .
And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at finding out an un@@ likely hypo@@ thesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
So in these circum@@ st@@ ances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experim@@ ental research program .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine L@@ eg@@ are &apos;s lab .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ lic@@ ket D@@ et@@ ect@@ ors .
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypo@@ th@@ eses in the space of two minutes .
( Video ) B@@ oy : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
Ali@@ son G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Okay , so his first hypo@@ thesis has just been fal@@ si@@ fied .
( Laughter ) B@@ oy : This one ligh@@ ted up , and this one nothing .
A@@ G : Okay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ ental not@@ e@@ book out .
B@@ oy : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : Every scientist will recognize that expres@@ sion of des@@ pair .
( Laughter ) B@@ oy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
A@@ G : Okay , hypo@@ thesis two .
B@@ oy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
He told the experiment@@ er to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
Not working either .
B@@ oy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
A@@ G : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypo@@ thesis .
B@@ oy : It &apos;s ligh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
A@@ G : Okay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hypo@@ thesis .
Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly ador@@ able and arti@@ cul@@ ate little boy , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?
What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant bu@@ tter@@ flies who can test five hypo@@ th@@ eses in two minutes ?
Well , if you go back to those psycho@@ logists and philosoph@@ ers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were bar@@ ely conscious if they were conscious at all .
And I think just the opposite is true .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spo@@ t@@ light .
So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to becomes extremely bright and vivi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dark .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So what happens when we pay attention is that the pre@@ fron@@ tal cortex , the sort of execu@@ tive part of our brains , sen@@ ds a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shu@@ ts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
So we have a very focused , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ driven kind of attention .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of consciousness than a spo@@ t@@ light of consciousness .
So babies and young children are very bad at n@@ arro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re f@@ loo@@ ded with these neur@@ otr@@ ans@@ mit@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and plas@@ ti@@ city , and the in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those bu@@ tter@@ flies who are designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a tas@@ te of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contr@@ acts , it expan@@ ds , so that those three days in Par@@ is seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been dr@@ inking down@@ st@@ airs , actually mi@@ mics the effect of those baby neur@@ otr@@ ans@@ mit@@ ters .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Par@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three doub@@ le-@@ es@@ pres@@ sos .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you wa@@ king up cr@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ nu@@ p .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ nu@@ p .
We can do things like tie our sho@@ el@@ aces and c@@ ross the street by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ tter@@ flies , to have open@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaig@@ ner .
And this is the name of my campaign : S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n .
In No@@ v@@ ember of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the la@@ unch of N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ dation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that Man@@ de@@ la had when he was im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed in Rob@@ ben Is@@ land .
And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ stage , having the time of my life .
The next day , all the artists were invited to join Man@@ de@@ la in Rob@@ ben Is@@ land , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his form@@ er prison cell .
You can see the bar@@ s of the window there .
It was quite a mo@@ ment@@ ous oc@@ c@@ asi@@ on for all of us .
In that moment in time , Man@@ de@@ la told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genoci@@ de taking place in his country ; that post-@@ apar@@ the@@ id R@@ ain@@ bo@@ w N@@ ation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS p@@ and@@ em@@ ic was directly aff@@ ecting women in such a way .
And so I commit@@ ted — when I left South Africa , when I left C@@ ape@@ town , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I particip@@ ated in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 event that I could take part in and gave news confer@@ ences , inter@@ views , talking and using my platform as a mu@@ sici@@ an , with my commit@@ ment to Man@@ de@@ la — out of respect for the tremendous , un@@ believ@@ able work that he had done .
Every@@ one in the world resp@@ ects N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la , everyone rever@@ es N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la .
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incid@@ ents of trans@@ mission of the virus ?
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sho@@ c@@ ked .
I was very , very fortun@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ ki@@ e A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the foun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n , an incredible campaig@@ ner and activi@@ st .
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 event .
He was wearing a t-@@ shi@@ r@@ t like the one I wear now .
This is a tool — this tells you I am in soli@@ dar@@ ity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
And in a way because of the sti@@ g@@ ma , by wearing this t-@@ shi@@ r@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot; &quot; I became a mem@@ ber of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n and I &apos;m very proud to be a mem@@ ber of that incredible organization .
It &apos;s a gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots campaign with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of whom are HI@@ V@@ -@@ positive .
They work in the field .
They have tremendous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
They have education programs .
They bring out the issues of sti@@ g@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
And yes , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n has sup@@ port@@ ed T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n in the way that I have tried to raise awar@@ eness and to try to also raise fun@@ ds .
A lot of the fun@@ ding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n and the incredible work that they do , and are still continu@@ ing to do in South Africa .
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ p@@ aig@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
I &apos;ve travel@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
Here I am in O@@ s@@ lo in Nor@@ way , getting a nice , f@@ at check ; singing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to raise money .
In Jo@@ han@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g , I had the opportunity to play to a main@@ ly white , mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class South African audience who ended up in t@@ ears because I use film cli@@ ps that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible trag@@ edy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to avoid , because they are f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
A@@ aron M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the current health min@@ ister , atten@@ ded that concer@@ t and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolu@@ te commit@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
This is in the Scot@@ tish Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ voy for Scot@@ land and HIV .
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awar@@ eness .
And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh with the wonderful African Chi@@ l@@ dren &apos;s C@@ ho@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore .
And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Mic@@ h@@ el Si@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the director of U@@ NA@@ IDS .
And I &apos;m very hon@@ ored by the fact that Mic@@ h@@ el invited me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ NA@@ IDS am@@ bas@@ s@@ ador .
And in this way , I &apos;ve been streng@@ th@@ ening my platform and broad@@ ening my ou@@ tre@@ ach .
The message that U@@ NA@@ IDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimin@@ ation of the trans@@ mission of the virus from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very ambi@@ ti@@ ous goal but we believe it can be achiev@@ ed with political will .
This can happen .
And here I am with a pregn@@ ant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re s@@ mi@@ ling , both of us are s@@ mi@@ ling , because we &apos;re very confid@@ ent , because we know that that young woman is recei@@ ving treatment so her life can be exten@@ ded to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
And her baby will recei@@ ve P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
Now that is pre@@ ven@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the AIDS p@@ and@@ em@@ ic .
Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me wher@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she repres@@ ents one of millions of HIV / AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from A@@ ID@@ S@@ -@@ related ill@@ ness .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus .
And here she is at seven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one year-old baby .
At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with fu@@ ll@@ -@@ blo@@ wn AIDS and had p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia .
We met her in a hospital in the E@@ aster@@ n Cap@@ e and spent a whole after@@ no@@ on with her — an ador@@ able child .
The doctors and nur@@ ses were phenomen@@ al .
They put her on very special nutri@@ ti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we fil@@ med her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feeling very reson@@ ant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
Fi@@ ve months later , we went back to South Africa to meet A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again .
And I &apos;m getting — the ha@@ irs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the ha@@ irs on my arms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the transformation that took place .
Is@@ n &apos;t it extraordinary ?
( Applause ) That round of ap@@ plause is actually for the doctors and nur@@ ses of the hospital who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you appreci@@ ate that kind of transformation .
So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutri@@ tion and good medical care , and you believe that the Mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment Go@@ als , specifically five and six , should be absolutely commit@@ ted to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa — could you please stand up .
I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the h@@ all .
Thank you very much .

Fi@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old Sovi@@ et Uni@@ on , a team of engineers was secre@@ tly moving a large object through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
With it , they were ho@@ ping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space .
The ro@@ cket was huge .
And pac@@ ked in its nose was a sil@@ ver ball with two radi@@ os inside .
On Oc@@ to@@ ber 4 , 195@@ 7 , they launched their ro@@ cket .
One of the Rus@@ sian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
In the ol@@ den days , explor@@ ers like V@@ as@@ co da G@@ ama and C@@ olu@@ m@@ bus had the good fortun@@ e to open up the ter@@ res@@ trial glo@@ be .
Now we have the good fortun@@ e to open up space .
And it is for those in the future to env@@ y us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th document@@ ary fe@@ ature , which is just about complet@@ ed .
It tells the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
For days after the la@@ unch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was a wonderful curiosi@@ ty .
A man@@ -@@ made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally launched an object into space .
But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed Mon@@ day , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our enem@@ y had be@@ aten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydro@@ gen bomb@@ s , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ro@@ cket as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ si@@ le .
All hell broke loo@@ se .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great sho@@ cks to hit America — histori@@ ans say the equal of P@@ ear@@ l Har@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It provo@@ ked the mis@@ si@@ le gap .
It explo@@ ded an arms race .
It began the space race .
Wi@@ thin a year , Con@@ gress fun@@ ded huge weapons incre@@ ases , and we went from 1,@@ 200 nuclear weapons to 20@@ ,000 .
And the reac@@ tions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k went far beyond weapons incre@@ ases .
For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ une 195@@ 8 , the National Ci@@ vil D@@ ef@@ ense D@@ ri@@ ll , where tens of millions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground .
Or the Gal@@ lu@@ p Pol@@ l that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
But S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k provo@@ ked wonderful changes as well .
For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
Su@@ p@@ port for engineering , math and science — education in general — bo@@ om@@ ed .
And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f points out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k led directly to AR@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
My fe@@ ature document@@ ary shows how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
But it also shows how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad situation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America .
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will soon be rele@@ ased .
In clo@@ sing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my invest@@ ors : long@@ time TED@@ ster , J@@ ay Wal@@ ker .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
( Applause ) .
Thank you , Chris .
Today , a b@@ af@@ fl@@ ed lady obser@@ ved the sh@@ ell where my sou@@ l d@@ wel@@ ls And announ@@ ced that I &apos;m &quot; arti@@ cul@@ ate &quot; Which means that when it comes to en@@ unci@@ ation and dic@@ tion I don &apos;t even think of it ‘ C@@ ause I ’ m &quot; &quot; arti@@ cul@@ ate &quot; &quot; So when my prof@@ essor as@@ ks a question And my answer is tain@@ ted with a con@@ not@@ ation of urban@@ ized sugg@@ estion There ’ s no mis@@ direc@@ ted inten@@ tion P@@ ay attention ‘ C@@ ause I ’ m “ arti@@ cul@@ ate ” So when my father as@@ ks , “ W@@ ha ’ kin@@ da ting is di@@ s ? ” My “ arti@@ cul@@ ate ” answer never goes am@@ is@@ s I say “ father , this is the im@@ pen@@ ding problem at hand ” And when I ’ m on the block I switch it up just because I can
So when my boy says , “ What ’ s good with you son ? ” I just say , “ I j@@ us ’ fall out w@@ it de@@ m people but I done ! ” And sometimes in class I might p@@ ause the intellec@@ tual so@@ un@@ ding flow to ask “ Yo ! Why des@@ e books ne@@ va be about my pe@@ o@@ ples ” Yes , I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equ@@ als Because I ’ m “ arti@@ cul@@ ate ” But who contr@@ ols arti@@ cul@@ ation ?
Because the English language is a multi@@ fac@@ et@@ ed or@@ ation Su@@ b@@ ject to in@@ defini@@ te transformation Now you may think that it is ignor@@ ant to speak broken English But I ’ m here to tell you that even “ arti@@ cul@@ ate ” Americans sound fo@@ o@@ li@@ sh to the British So when my Pro@@ f@@ essor comes on the block and says , “ H@@ ello ” I stop him and say “ No@@ o@@ o@@ o … You ’ re being in@@ arti@@ cul@@ ate … the pro@@ per way is to say ‘ what ’ s good ’ ” Now you may think that ’ s too hood , that ’ s not cool But I ’ m here to tell you that even our language has rules So when M@@ om@@ my mo@@ cks me and says “ ya ’ ll@@ -@@ be@@ -@@ mad@@ d-@@ go@@ ing@@ -@@ to-@@ the@@ -@@ store ” I say “ M@@ om@@ my , no , that sentence is not following the law
N@@ ever does the word &quot; &quot; mad@@ d &quot; &quot; go before a present partici@@ ple That ’ s simply the principle of this English ” If I had the voc@@ al capacity I would sing this from every moun@@ tain@@ top , From every sub@@ ur@@ bia , and every hood ‘ C@@ ause the only God of language is the one recor@@ ded in the Gen@@ esis Of this world saying “ it is good &quot; &quot; So I may not always come before you with excel@@ l@@ ency of speech But do not jud@@ ge me by my language and assu@@ me That I ’ m too ignor@@ ant to teach ‘ C@@ ause I speak three ton@@ gues One for each : Ho@@ me , school and friends I ’ m a tri@@ -@@ lin@@ gu@@ al or@@ ator Sometimes I ’ m consist@@ ent with my language now

Good morning . So magic is an excel@@ l@@ ent way for st@@ aying ahead of the reality cur@@ ve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
As a cy@@ ber@@ -@@ magi@@ ci@@ an , I comb@@ ine elements of illu@@ sion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Pro@@ ject G@@ l@@ ass .
It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is au@@ g@@ ment@@ ed with data : names of places , mon@@ u@@ ments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the str@@ angers that pass you on the street .
So these are my illu@@ sion gl@@ as@@ ses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototy@@ pe .
And when you look through them , you get a gli@@ mp@@ se into the mind of the cy@@ ber@@ -@@ illu@@ sion@@ ist .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a playing card . An@@ y card will do .
Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
All right . Very significant mark .
And let &apos;s put it back into the dec@@ k , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
( Music ) Vo@@ ice : Sy@@ stem ready . Ac@@ qui@@ ring image .
Mar@@ co T@@ emp@@ est : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a dec@@ k of cards is made up of four different su@@ its : hear@@ ts , clu@@ bs , di@@ am@@ on@@ ds and sp@@ ades .
The cards are am@@ ong@@ st the ol@@ dest of symbo@@ ls , and have been interpre@@ ted in many different ways .
Now , some say that the four su@@ its represent the four se@@ as@@ ons .
There &apos;s spring , summer , au@@ tu@@ m@@ n and â   Vo@@ ice : My favorite se@@ ason is w@@ inter@@ .@@ M@@ T : Well yeah , mine too .
W@@ in@@ ter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when war@@ m@@ th turns to cold , water turns to s@@ now , and then it all dis@@ appe@@ ars .
There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Vo@@ ice : Each card repres@@ ents a pha@@ se of the 13 lun@@ ar cy@@ cles .
M@@ T : So over here is low ti@@ de , and over here is high ti@@ de , and in the middle is the moon .
Vo@@ ice : The moon is one of the most pot@@ ent symbo@@ ls of magic .
M@@ T : There are two colors in a dec@@ k of cards .
There is the color red and the color black , represent@@ ing the const@@ ant change from day to night .
Vo@@ ice : Mar@@ co , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) M@@ T : And is it a co@@ incid@@ ence that there are 5@@ 2 cards in a dec@@ k of cards , just as there are 5@@ 2 weeks in a year ?
( Music ) Vo@@ ice : If you total all the spo@@ ts on a dec@@ k of cards , the result is 3@@ 65 .
M@@ T : Oh , 3@@ 65 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each bir@@ th@@ day .
M@@ ake a wish . ( B@@ lowing noise ) Vo@@ ice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
M@@ T : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my six@@ th bir@@ th@@ day that I received my first dec@@ k of cards , and ever since that day , I have travel@@ ed around the world perform@@ ing magic for boys and girls , men and women , hus@@ ban@@ ds and wi@@ ves , even k@@ ings and que@@ ens . ( Applause ) Vo@@ ice : And who are these ? M@@ T : Ah , mis@@ chi@@ ef@@ -@@ makers . W@@ atch .
W@@ ake up .
Jo@@ ker : W@@ ho@@ a@@ .@@ M@@ T : Are you ready for your party piece ?
Jo@@ ker : Re@@ ady ! M@@ T : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
Jo@@ ker : P@@ res@@ ent@@ ing my po@@ go stic@@ k@@ .@@ M@@ T : Ah . W@@ atch out .
Jo@@ ker : W@@ ho@@ a , wh@@ o@@ a , wh@@ o@@ a , oh ! ( Music ) M@@ T : But today , I am perform@@ ing for a different kind of audience .
I &apos;m perform@@ ing for you .
Vo@@ ice : Sig@@ ned card detect@@ ed@@ .@@ M@@ T : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magi@@ ci@@ an ? Is it a 9@@ -@@ to-@@ 5 job ?
Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
24 / 7 is a little bit of an exag@@ ger@@ ation , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evi@@ l super@@ natural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) W@@ ho@@ a .
Well , to this , I just say , no no .
Actually , in Ger@@ man , it &apos;s ne@@ in ne@@ in . ( Laughter ) Mag@@ ic isn &apos;t that inten@@ se . I have to war@@ n you , though , if you ever play with someone who de@@ als cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
( Music ) Vo@@ ice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The od@@ ds of getting it are 4@@ ,@@ 1@@ 65 to one .
M@@ T : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the od@@ ds .
Vo@@ ice : I think you got your bir@@ th@@ day w@@ ish@@ .@@ M@@ T : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
And un@@ like anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not@@ .@@ Vo@@ ice : Sig@@ ned card det@@ ected .
D@@ ig@@ ital M@@ T : This is without a question the real thing .
M@@ T : B@@ ye b@@ ye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been at MIT for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvious .
Have they all agre@@ ed ? No , not completely .
I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
I have so much money , it takes me forever .
I grew up in Bi@@ har , India &apos;s po@@ or@@ est state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a car@@ t full of the most deli@@ cious swe@@ ets at our do@@ or@@ step .
My bro@@ thers and I du@@ g in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
He was li@@ vi@@ d , and I still remember how we cri@@ ed when that car@@ t with our hal@@ f-@@ e@@ aten swe@@ ets was pu@@ lled away from us .
L@@ ater , I understood why my father got so up@@ set .
Those swe@@ ets were a bri@@ be from a contr@@ actor who was trying to get my father to a@@ ward him a government contr@@ act .
My father was responsible for building roads in Bi@@ har , and he had developed a fir@@ m st@@ ance against corruption , even though he was har@@ as@@ sed and thre@@ aten@@ ed .
His was a lon@@ ely struggle , because Bi@@ har was also India &apos;s most corrup@@ t state , where public of@@ fici@@ als were en@@ r@@ ich@@ ing themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than ser@@ ving the poor who had no means to expres@@ s their angu@@ ish if their children had no food or no scho@@ ol@@ ing .
And I experienced this most vis@@ cer@@ ally when I travel@@ ed to remote vill@@ ages to study poverty .
And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was fam@@ ished and ex@@ ha@@ usted , and I was almost collap@@ sing in a s@@ cor@@ ching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the po@@ or@@ est men in that village invited me into his hu@@ t and graci@@ ously f@@ ed me .
On@@ ly I later realized that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This profound gift of gener@@ osi@@ ty challen@@ ged and changed the very purpose of my life .
I resol@@ ved to give back .
L@@ ater , I jo@@ ined the World B@@ ank , which s@@ ought to fight such poverty by transfer@@ ring aid from rich to poor countries .
My initi@@ al work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negoti@@ ating re@@ forms with the Fin@@ ance Min@@ istry of Uganda so they could access our lo@@ ans .
But after we dis@@ bur@@ sed the lo@@ ans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found new@@ ly built schools without tex@@ t@@ books or teachers , new health clin@@ ics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or re@@ course .
It was Bi@@ har all over again .
Bi@@ har repres@@ ents the challenge of development : ab@@ ject poverty surro@@ unded by corruption .
Glob@@ ally , 1.@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1.@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda repres@@ ents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practic@@ ed since 194@@ 4 , when win@@ ners of World War II , 500 foun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ ely foun@@ ding mother , gather@@ ed in New H@@ amp@@ shi@@ re , U@@ SA , to establi@@ sh the B@@ re@@ tton W@@ o@@ ods institutions , including the World B@@ ank .
And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , trans@@ fer of resources from rich countries in the North to po@@ ore@@ r countries in the South , ac@@ compani@@ ed by re@@ form pres@@ crip@@ tions .
Second , the development institutions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these transfer@@ s were op@@ aque , with little transpar@@ ency of what they fin@@ anced or what results they achiev@@ ed .
And third , the eng@@ agement in developing countries was with a n@@ arro@@ w set of government eli@@ tes with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ulti@@ mate benefici@@ aries of development as@@ sist@@ ance .
Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dram@@ atic changes in the global environment .
O@@ p@@ en knowledge , open aid , open govern@@ ance , and together , they represent three key shif@@ ts that are transform@@ ing development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I wit@@ n@@ essed in Uganda and in Bi@@ har .
The first key shift is open knowledge .
You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are hand@@ ed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World B@@ ank .
They get their inspir@@ ation , their hope , their prac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from successful emerging economi@@ es in the South .
They want to know how China lif@@ ted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s O@@ port@@ unidades program impro@@ ved scho@@ ol@@ ing and nutri@@ tion for millions of children .
This is the new ecos@@ y@@ stem of open@@ -@@ knowledge flo@@ ws , not just travel@@ ing North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s O@@ port@@ unidades today inspir@@ ing New York City .
And just as these Nor@@ th-@@ to-@@ South transfer@@ s are opening up , so too are the development institutions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these transfer@@ s .
This is the second shift : open aid .
R@@ ec@@ ently , the World B@@ ank opened its v@@ aul@@ t of data for public use , rele@@ as@@ ing 8@@ ,000 economic and social indic@@ ators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crow@@ d@@ source innov@@ ative ap@@ ps using this data .
D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment institutions today are also opening for public s@@ cru@@ tiny the projects they fin@@ ance .
Take Ge@@ o@@ M@@ ap@@ ping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools fin@@ anced by don@@ ors are loc@@ ated , and the dar@@ ker the sha@@ de of green , the more the number of out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children .
So this simple mas@@ hu@@ p reve@@ als that don@@ ors have not fin@@ anced any schools in the areas with the most out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children , provo@@ king new questions . Is development as@@ sist@@ ance tar@@ get@@ ing those who most need our help ?
In this man@@ ner , the World B@@ ank has now Ge@@ o@@ M@@ apped 3@@ 0,000 project activi@@ ties in 14@@ 3 countries , and don@@ ors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
This is a tremendous le@@ ap forward in transpar@@ ency and accoun@@ t@@ ability of aid .
And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open govern@@ ance . Go@@ vern@@ ments today are opening up just as citizens are dem@@ anding voice and accoun@@ t@@ ability .
From the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ na H@@ az@@ are movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accoun@@ t@@ ability but also for development accoun@@ t@@ ability .
Are governments deli@@ vering services to the citizens ?
So for instance , several governments in Africa and E@@ aster@@ n Europe are opening their bud@@ gets to the public .
But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s acc@@ es@@ sible .
This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really acc@@ es@@ sible or underst@@ and@@ able to an ordinary citiz@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
To t@@ ack@@ le this problem , governments are using new tools to visu@@ alize the budget so it &apos;s more underst@@ and@@ able to the public .
In this map from M@@ ol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those distr@@ ic@@ ts that have low spending on schools but good educ@@ ational out@@ comes , and the red color shows the opposite .
To@@ ols like this help turn a shel@@ f full of ins@@ cru@@ table docu@@ ments into a public@@ ly underst@@ and@@ able visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this open@@ ness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
So in the Phi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines today , parents and students can give real@@ -@@ time feedback on a website , Ch@@ ec@@ k@@ my@@ scho@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ MS , whether teachers and tex@@ t@@ books are showing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ n@@ essed in Uganda and in Bi@@ har .
And the government is respon@@ sive . So for instance , when it was report@@ ed on this website that 800 students were at risk because school rep@@ airs had st@@ all@@ ed due to corruption , the De@@ partment of E@@ duc@@ ation in the Phi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines took swi@@ ft action .
And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spre@@ ading South to South , from the Phi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines to In@@ don@@ esia , Kenya , M@@ ol@@ do@@ va and beyond .
In D@@ ar es Sal@@ a@@ am , T@@ anz@@ ania , even an im@@ pover@@ ished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspir@@ ations .
This is what the map of T@@ and@@ ale looked like in Au@@ g@@ ust , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open@@ -@@ source platform to dram@@ atically map the entire community infrastructure .
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated in the red bu@@ b@@ bles that you see , which together provi@@ des a grap@@ hic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
Today , even Bi@@ har is turning around and opening up under a commit@@ ted leadership that is making government transpar@@ ent , acc@@ es@@ sible and respon@@ sive to the poor .
But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in ser@@ ving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are the lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of development work is to help these lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors join hands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds .
So for instance , today , in Ghana , cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous re@@ form@@ ers from civil society , Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent and government , have for@@ ged a co@@ ali@@ tion for transpar@@ ent contr@@ acts in the oil sector , and , gal@@ van@@ ized by this , re@@ form@@ ers in Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent are now investig@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous contr@@ acts .
These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I wit@@ n@@ essed in Uganda or that my father confron@@ ted in Bi@@ har .
Two years ago , on A@@ pri@@ l 8@@ th , 2010 , I called my father .
It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was ty@@ ping a 7@@ 0-@@ page public interest li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation against corruption in a road project .
Th@@ ough he was no law@@ yer , he argu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t himself the next day . He won the r@@ ul@@ ing , but later that very ev@@ ening , he fell , and he died .
He f@@ ought till the end , increasingly passionate that to comb@@ at corruption and poverty , not only did government of@@ fici@@ als need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
These became the two boo@@ k@@ ends of his life , and the journey he travel@@ ed in between mir@@ ro@@ red the changing development landscape .
Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World B@@ ank , we are embr@@ ac@@ ing these new direc@@ tions , a significant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
We need to radic@@ ally open up development so knowledge flo@@ ws in multiple direc@@ tions , inspir@@ ing practi@@ tion@@ ers , so aid becomes transpar@@ ent , accoun@@ table and effective , so governments open up and citizens are eng@@ aged and em@@ powered with re@@ form@@ ers in government .
We need to acceler@@ ate these shif@@ ts .
If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bi@@ har , in Uganda , and beyond .
We will find that tex@@ t@@ books and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of bre@@ aking their way out of poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
So imagine that a plane is about to cr@@ ash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five cr@@ ash every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
Most of these dea@@ ths are pre@@ vent@@ able , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me an@@ gry , and it makes me determin@@ ed .
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ dest inv@@ enti@@ ons : a bar of so@@ ap .
Wash@@ ing hands with so@@ ap , a hab@@ it we all take for gr@@ ant@@ ed , can reduce di@@ arr@@ he@@ a by half , can reduce respir@@ atory infec@@ tions by one third .
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap can have an impact on reduc@@ ing flu , trac@@ ho@@ ma , S@@ AR@@ S , and most recently in the case of ch@@ ol@@ era and E@@ bola out@@ break , one of the key inter@@ venti@@ ons is hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap .
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap keeps kids in school .
It stop@@ s babies from dying .
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap is one of the most cost@@ -@@ effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
It can save over 6@@ 00,000 children every year .
That &apos;s the equivalent of stop@@ ping 10 ju@@ mb@@ o j@@ ets full of babies and children from cr@@ ash@@ ing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a minute .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just sha@@ ke their hands .
Please sha@@ ke their hands .
All right , get to know each other .
They look really pretty .
All right .
So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just sho@@ ok actually didn &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they were coming out of the toi@@ let ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
P@@ ret@@ ty y@@ uc@@ ky , you would agree with me .
Well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they come out of the toi@@ let , glob@@ ally .
And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got f@@ ancy toi@@ lets , running water , and so@@ ap available , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high .
What is it ? Is there no so@@ ap ?
Actually , so@@ ap is available .
In 90 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in Kenya , you will find so@@ ap .
Even in countries where so@@ ap is the low@@ est , like E@@ thi@@ opi@@ a , we are at 50 percent .
So why is it ?
Why aren &apos;t people was@@ h@@ ing their hands ?
Why is it that May@@ ank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t was@@ h@@ ing his hands ?
Well , in May@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ ap is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ ap is used for laun@@ dry , so@@ ap is used for was@@ h@@ ing dis@@ h@@ es .
His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a preci@@ ous com@@ modi@@ ty , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ board .
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
On average , in May@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use so@@ ap for was@@ h@@ ing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for was@@ h@@ ing hands with so@@ ap .
What &apos;s the result of that ?
Chi@@ l@@ dren pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
Think about where you learned to was@@ h your hands .
Did you learn to was@@ h your hands at home ?
Did you learn to was@@ h your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ oral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the hab@@ its that you have had early in life .
However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural nor@@ ms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
Every second in Asia and Africa , 1@@ 11 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Uni@@ le@@ ver , that allows us to keep talking about hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap and hy@@ gi@@ ene to these mothers .
Big businesses and br@@ ands can change and shift those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those hab@@ its that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Think about it : Mar@@ k@@ et@@ e@@ ers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into comp@@ el@@ ling mess@@ ages .
Just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap .
The profit mo@@ tive is transform@@ ing health out@@ comes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for cent@@ uries : the Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ oy brand was launched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in V@@ ic@@ tori@@ an England to actually comb@@ at ch@@ ol@@ era .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the min@@ ister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ era out@@ break in Ghana at the moment .
A hundred and ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have access to this bar of so@@ ap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from spre@@ ading .
I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most commit@@ ted char@@ ity or government .
Go@@ vern@@ ment is doing what they can , especially in terms of the p@@ and@@ em@@ ics and epidem@@ ics such as ch@@ ol@@ era , or E@@ bola at the moment , but with compe@@ ting priori@@ ties .
The budget is not always there .
And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing a daily hab@@ it , it requires sustain@@ ed fun@@ ding to re@@ fine this behavior .
In short , those that fight for public health are actually depend@@ ent upon the so@@ ap companies to keep promot@@ ing hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap .
W@@ in for the public sector , because we help them reach their tar@@ gets .
And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
On Oc@@ to@@ ber 15 , we will celebr@@ ate Global H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing D@@ ay .
S@@ cho@@ ols , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competi@@ tors , we all join hands to celebr@@ ate the world &apos;s most important public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
I ur@@ ge you to take five minutes and look at those fil@@ ms .
I come from Mal@@ i , one of the world &apos;s po@@ or@@ est countries .
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doc@@ tor@@ ate in hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promot@@ ing the world &apos;s best inven@@ tion in public health : so@@ ap .
We &apos;ve re@@ ached over 18@@ 3 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the ambi@@ tion to reach one billion by 20@@ 20 .
It may be un@@ comfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equ@@ ated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
Wi@@ th@@ out it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
Last week , my team and I spent time visi@@ ting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a new@@ born .
I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more pain@@ ful .
This one is from M@@ y@@ an@@ mar .
She had the most beautiful s@@ mile , the s@@ mile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
H@@ er son , M@@ yo , is her second one .
And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her so@@ ap .
It &apos;s the most beautiful inven@@ tion in public health .
These are simple objects : c@@ loc@@ ks , keys , comb@@ s , gl@@ as@@ ses .
The fact that some of the victims car@@ ried personal it@@ ems such as to@@ o@@ th@@ pas@@ te and a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
Dur@@ ing the four years of conflict that devast@@ ated the B@@ os@@ ni@@ an nation in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , appro@@ xim@@ ately 3@@ 0,000 citizens , main@@ ly civi@@ li@@ ans , went missing , presu@@ med killed , and another 100,000 were killed during comb@@ at oper@@ ations .
The international criminal trib@@ un@@ al deli@@ vered a number of s@@ enten@@ ces for cri@@ mes against humanity and genoci@@ de .
Gen@@ oci@@ de is a syst@@ em@@ atic and deliber@@ ate destruc@@ tion of a raci@@ al , political , religious or eth@@ ni@@ c group .
As much as genoci@@ de is about killing .
It is also about destro@@ ying their property , their cultural her@@ it@@ age , and ultimately the very notion that they ever exist@@ ed .
Gen@@ oci@@ de is not only about the killing ; it is about the den@@ i@@ ed identity .
There are always tr@@ aces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
There are always re@@ m@@ n@@ ants of the per@@ ished ones that are more dur@@ able than their frag@@ i@@ le bodies and our sel@@ ective and f@@ ading memory of them .
Not a single body should re@@ main un@@ discovered or uni@@ d@@ enti@@ fied .
Once reco@@ vered , these it@@ ems that the victims car@@ ried with them on their way to execu@@ tion are carefully clean@@ ed , analy@@ zed , cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed and st@@ ored .
Th@@ ou@@ sands of arti@@ facts are pac@@ ked in white plastic b@@ ags just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
These objects are used as a for@@ en@@ sic tool in visual identific@@ ation of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable for@@ en@@ sic evidence in the on@@ going war cri@@ mes tri@@ als .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single ex@@ hu@@ med it@@ em in order to create a visual archi@@ ve that surviv@@ ors could easily bro@@ w@@ se .
As a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler , I like to give back to the community .
I like to move beyond rais@@ ing awar@@ eness .
Ph@@ ot@@ ograph@@ y is about empa@@ thy , and the famili@@ ar@@ ity of these it@@ ems guar@@ ant@@ ee empa@@ thy .
In this case , I am mer@@ ely a tool , a for@@ en@@ sic , if you like , and the result is a photograph@@ y that is as close as possible of being a docu@@ ment .
Thank you very much .
But that can &apos;t be right .
I am for chocolate don@@ u@@ ts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day challenges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
I would never have been that ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day challenges .
It &apos;s awful .
In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
( Applause )
H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
Since we are still realiz@@ ing these works , we are larg@@ ely working within the real@@ m of intui@@ tion and myst@@ ery , still .
So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the Im@@ peri@@ al Mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ mes .
A vie@@ wer sort of un@@ sus@@ p@@ ect@@ ingly wal@@ ks into the room , and cat@@ ches a gli@@ mp@@ se of these pan@@ els in a mess@@ y com@@ position on the wall .
Wi@@ thin seconds , as if the pan@@ els have noticed the pres@@ ence of the vie@@ wer , they appear to p@@ anic and sort of get into a str@@ ic@@ t sym@@ metry .
( Laughter ) So this is the sk@@ et@@ ch of the two states .
One is total cha@@ os . The other is absolu@@ te order .
And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
This also remin@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ tori@@ al tradi@@ tions .
One is the al@@ tar tab@@ lets of the 15@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Mal@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s abstr@@ act com@@ posi@@ tions .
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
To give you a sense of scale , the largest pan@@ el is about two meters high .
That &apos;s about this much . And the small@@ est one is an A@@ 4 .
So a vie@@ wer ent@@ ers the space , and they sn@@ ap to attention .
( Laughter ) So here it appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s the vie@@ wer that &apos;s sort of in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating the sense of order among the pan@@ els , but it could also be the other way around , that the pan@@ els are so stuck within their pre@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed behavi@@ ors that they sort of thr@@ ust the vie@@ wer with the role of a ty@@ r@@ ant .
So this brings me to a qui@@ e@@ ter , small work called H@@ and@@ held .
The vie@@ wer se@@ es a piece of paper that &apos;s moun@@ ted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a bl@@ ank A@@ 4 , or a let@@ ter@@ -@@ si@@ zed piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be car@@ ved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
The vie@@ wer also se@@ es that this entire sculp@@ ture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not man@@ aging to .
So this inst@@ ability in the movement very clo@@ sely res@@ em@@ bles the un@@ ste@@ ady nature of images seen through a hand@@ held camera .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tan@@ de@@ m cli@@ ps .
One is through a still camera and the other is through a hand@@ held camera .
And you immediately see how the un@@ ste@@ ady nature of the video sugg@@ ests the pres@@ ence of an obser@@ ver and a subj@@ ective point of view .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ moved the camera and transfer@@ red that movement onto the pan@@ el .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to ev@@ o@@ ke a self-@@ ef@@ facing g@@ est@@ ure , as if there &apos;s a little person with out@@ stre@@ t@@ ched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
That sort of lik@@ ens it to the amount of str@@ ain to be at the service of the obser@@ ver and present this piece of paper very de@@ lic@@ ately to the vie@@ wer in front of them .
The next work is De@@ co@@ y .
This is a car@@ d@@ board model , so the object is about as t@@ all as I am .
It has a ro@@ unded body , two arms , and a very t@@ all , head@@ -@@ like an@@ ten@@ na , and its so@@ le purpose is to at@@ tr@@ act attention towards itself .
So when a vie@@ wer pas@@ ses by , it sort of til@@ ts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more fran@@ tically as the person gets closer .
So here is the first test sc@@ enario .
You see the two movements integr@@ ated , and the object seems to be empl@@ o@@ ying its entire being in this expres@@ sion of desper@@ ation .
But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
( Laughter ) So this is the final fabric@@ ated body of the De@@ co@@ y .
It appe@@ ars to be mas@@ s-@@ manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red like it came out of a factory like v@@ acu@@ um clean@@ ers and was@@ h@@ ing machines .
Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consu@@ mer a@@ es@@ thetic sort of de@@ person@@ aliz@@ es the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appear@@ ance , at least .
And so to us this is a kind of sin@@ ister being which is trying to distr@@ act you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instru@@ ment .
In the shape of an am@@ phi@@ theater that &apos;s scal@@ ed to the size of an audience as percei@@ ved from somebody from the stage .
So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appe@@ ars to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
Se@@ ated in this audience are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small figur@@ es .
They &apos;re mechan@@ ically en@@ abled to cl@@ ap of their own free will .
This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to cl@@ ap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influ@@ enced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribu@@ te to innovation .
So when the vie@@ wer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
It could be a few cl@@ aps or a strong ap@@ plause , and then nothing happens until the vie@@ wer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
It could be anything from a few fe@@ e@@ ble cl@@ aps from members in the audience , or it could be a very l@@ oud ov@@ ation .
So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of mu@@ si@@ cal@@ -@@ like quality to it , an instru@@ ment .
So the vie@@ wer can play it by eli@@ ci@@ ting quite complex and vari@@ ed , nu@@ anced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provo@@ ke the audience into any particular kind of response .
So there &apos;s a sense of jud@@ g@@ ment and cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ousness and un@@ eas@@ iness involved .
It also has an all@@ uring and tr@@ ap@@ -@@ like quality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head sp@@ li@@ tting to form the two hands .
So here &apos;s a small visual anima@@ tion , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clas@@ h@@ ing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the ten@@ sion .
And here is a prototy@@ pe .
So we can &apos;t wait to be en@@ gu@@ l@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Fr@@ amer@@ un@@ ners .
This is an actual window in our studi@@ o , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ick@@ n@@ esses of wo@@ o@@ den sec@@ tions .
This gri@@ d is in@@ hab@@ ited by a tri@@ be of small figur@@ es .
They &apos;re also made up of three different si@@ zes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single pla@@ in .
Each of these figur@@ es can also run back@@ ward and forward in the track and hi@@ de behind two ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent trac@@ ks .
So in contr@@ ast to this very ti@@ ght gri@@ d , we wanted to give these figur@@ es a very com@@ ical and s@@ lap@@ stic@@ k@@ -@@ like quality , as if a pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er has taken them and physic@@ ally anim@@ ated them down the path .
So to us , this work also pres@@ ents its own contradic@@ tion .
So all these real life qu@@ alities that I talk about are sort of transl@@ ated to a very specific technical configur@@ ation , and we were very lucky to collabor@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Z@@ ur@@ ich to develop the first prototy@@ pe .
So you see they extr@@ acted the motion co@@ gs from our anima@@ tions and created a w@@ ig@@ g@@ le that integr@@ ated the head@@ -@@ bo@@ b@@ bing movement and the back@@ -@@ and-@@ forth movement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can fit into the pal@@ m of my hand .
So imagine our exci@@ tem@@ ent when we saw it really working in the studi@@ o , and here it is .
So in college , I was a government major , which means I had to write a lot of papers .
Now , when a normal student writ@@ es a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little slowly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some he@@ avi@@ er days later on , everything gets done , things stay civil . ( Laughter )
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the plan .
I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
But then came my 9@@ 0-@@ page sen@@ ior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an op@@ tion .
It was way too big a project .
So I plan@@ ned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this .
This is how the year would go .
How hard could it be to walk up the st@@ airs ?
No big deal , right ?
But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened .
Those first few months ?
They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff .
So we had an awesome new revis@@ ed plan .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
And one day I wo@@ ke up with three days until the de@@ ad@@ line , still not having written a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wrote 90 pages over 7@@ 2 hours , pu@@ lling not one but two all@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — humans are not supposed to pull two all@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — s@@ prin@@ ted across cam@@ pus , do@@ ve in slow motion , and got it in just at the de@@ ad@@ line .
I thought that was the end of everything .
But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school .
And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this Ti@@ m U@@ r@@ ban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
It was a very , very bad thesis . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was very , very bad .
Any@@ way , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er-@@ b@@ log@@ ger guy .
I write the blog W@@ a@@ it But Why .
And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation .
My behavior has always per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ed the non-@@ proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ators around me , and I wanted to explain to the non-@@ proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ators of the world what goes on in the heads of proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ators , and why we are the way we are .
Now , I had a hypo@@ thesis that the brains of proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ators were actually different than the brains of other people .
And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I lab that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven non-@@ proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator , so I could compare them .
I actually brought them here to show you today .
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
I know that if you &apos;re not a trained brain exper@@ t , it &apos;s not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
So here &apos;s the brain of a non-@@ proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator .
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
B@@ oth brains have a R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ aker in them , but the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s brain also has an In@@ st@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key .
Now , what does this mean for the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ?
Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
&#91; This is a perfect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; N@@ op@@ e ! &#93; So the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ aker will make the rational decision to do something productive , but the Mon@@ key doesn &apos;t like that plan , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; &quot; Actually , let &apos;s read the entire Wikipedia page of the N@@ ancy K@@ erri@@ gan / T@@ on@@ ya Har@@ ding sc@@ and@@ al , because I just remem@@ ber@@ ed that that happened .
After that , we &apos;re going to go on a YouTube spir@@ al that starts with videos of Richard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man talking about magne@@ ts and ends much , much later with us watching inter@@ views with J@@ usti@@ n Bi@@ e@@ ber &apos;s mom .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the sch@@ ed@@ u@@ le for any work today .
Sor@@ ry ! &quot; &quot; ( Si@@ gh ) Now , what is going on here ?
The In@@ st@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key does not seem like a guy you want behind the whe@@ el .
He lives entirely in the present moment .
He has no memory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only car@@ es about two things : easy and fun .
Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
( Laughter ) And to the Mon@@ key , humans are just another animal species .
You have to keep well-@@ sle@@ p@@ t , well-@@ f@@ ed and propag@@ ating into the next generation , which in trib@@ al times might have worked OK .
But , if you haven &apos;t noticed , now we &apos;re not in trib@@ al times .
We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , and the Mon@@ key does not know what that is .
Which is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ aker , who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do .
We can visu@@ alize the future .
We can see the big picture .
We can make long-@@ term plan@@ s .
And he wants to take all of that into account .
And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you &apos;re having dinner or going to bed or enjo@@ ying well-@@ ear@@ ned le@@ is@@ ure time .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s an over@@ la@@ p .
Sometimes they agree .
But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleas@@ ant , for the sa@@ ke of the big picture .
And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
And for the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator , that conflict ten@@ ds to end a certain way every time , leaving him spending a lot of time in this or@@ ange zone , an easy and fun place that &apos;s entirely out of the Ma@@ kes S@@ ense circle .
I call it the Dar@@ k P@@ lay@@ ground .
( Laughter ) Now , the Dar@@ k P@@ lay@@ ground is a place that all of you proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ators out there know very well .
It &apos;s where le@@ is@@ ure activi@@ ties happen at times when le@@ is@@ ure activi@@ ties are not supposed to be happening .
The fun you have in the Dar@@ k P@@ lay@@ ground isn &apos;t actually fun , because it &apos;s completely un@@ ear@@ ned , and the air is filled with gu@@ il@@ t , dre@@ ad , an@@ xi@@ ety , self-@@ hat@@ red — all of those good proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator feelings .
And the question is , in this situation , with the Mon@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleas@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?
Well , turns out the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator has a guar@@ di@@ an ang@@ el , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and watching over him in his dar@@ k@@ est moments — someone called the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster .
( Laughter ) Now , the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster is dor@@ man@@ t most of the time , but he suddenly wa@@ kes up any@@ time a de@@ ad@@ line gets too close or there &apos;s dan@@ ger of public embar@@ ras@@ s@@ ment , a career dis@@ aster or some other scar@@ y consequ@@ ence .
And importantly , he &apos;s the only thing the Mon@@ key is terri@@ fied of .
Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED re@@ ached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes .
It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this exci@@ tem@@ ent , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ aker seemed to have something else on his mind .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Are we clear on what we just accep@@ ted ?
Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
We need to sit down and work on this right now . &quot; &quot; And the Mon@@ key said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ot@@ ally agree , but let &apos;s just open Google Earth and zo@@ om in to the bottom of India , like 200 feet above the ground , and sc@@ roll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the spe@@ akers .
And I opened up the website , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me .
And guess who wo@@ ke up ?
( Laughter ) So the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system &apos;s in may@@ he@@ m . ( Laughter )
And the Mon@@ key — remember , he &apos;s terri@@ fied of the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster — bo@@ om , he &apos;s up the tree !
And finally , finally , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ aker can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk .
Now , the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster expla@@ ins all kinds of pretty in@@ san@@ e proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator behavior , like how someone like me could spend two weeks un@@ able to start the opening sentence of a paper , and then mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously find the un@@ believ@@ able work eth@@ ic to stay up all night and write eight pages .
And this entire situation , with the three characters — this is the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system .
It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
When I did , I was amaz@@ ed by the response .
L@@ iter@@ ally thousands of em@@ ails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
These are people who were nur@@ ses , ban@@ kers , pa@@ inter@@ s , engineers and lots and lots of Ph@@ D students .
( Laughter ) And they were all writing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;
But what struc@@ k me was the contr@@ ast between the light t@@ one of the pos@@ t and the heav@@ iness of these em@@ ails .
These people were writing with inten@@ se frustr@@ ation about what proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this Mon@@ key had done to them .
And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?
Why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation .
Everything I &apos;ve talked about today , the examples I &apos;ve given , they all have de@@ ad@@ lines .
And when there &apos;s de@@ ad@@ lines , the effects of proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation are con@@ tain@@ ed to the short term because the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster gets involved .
But there &apos;s a second kind of proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation that happens in situ@@ ations when there is no de@@ ad@@ line .
So if you wanted a career where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter — something in the arts , something entreprene@@ uri@@ al — there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ lines on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get mo@@ ment@@ um , get things going .
There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don &apos;t invol@@ ve any de@@ ad@@ lines , like seeing your family or exerci@@ sing and taking care of your health , working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn &apos;t working .
Now if the proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s only mechan@@ ism of doing these hard things is the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these non-@@ de@@ ad@@ line situ@@ ations , the P@@ anic Mon@@ ster doesn &apos;t show up .
He has nothing to wake up for , so the effects of proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation , they &apos;re not con@@ tain@@ ed ; they just exten@@ d ou@@ tw@@ ard forever .
And it &apos;s this long-@@ term kind of proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation that &apos;s much less visible and much less talked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , shor@@ t-@@ term de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e-@@ based kind .
It &apos;s usually suffer@@ ed qui@@ et@@ ly and priv@@ ately .
And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-@@ term un@@ happiness , and re@@ gre@@ ts .
And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are em@@ ail@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cr@@ am@@ ming for some project .
It &apos;s that long-@@ term proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation has made them feel like a sp@@ ect@@ ator , at times , in their own lives .
The frustr@@ ation is not that they couldn &apos;t achieve their dreams ; it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t even able to start cha@@ sing them .
So I read these em@@ ails and I had a little bit of an epi@@ ph@@ any — that I don &apos;t think non-@@ proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ators exist .
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ators .
Now , you might not all be a m@@ ess , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with de@@ ad@@ lines , but remember : the Mon@@ key &apos;s s@@ ne@@ a@@ ki@@ est tr@@ ick is when the de@@ ad@@ lines aren &apos;t there .
Now , I want to show you one last thing .
I call this a Life Cal@@ en@@ dar .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0-@@ year life .
That &apos;s not that many bo@@ xes , especially since we &apos;ve already used a bunch of those .
So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ en@@ dar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re really proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on , because everyone is proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on something in life .
We need to stay aware of the In@@ st@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
And because there &apos;s not that many bo@@ xes on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today .
Well , maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Some@@ time soon .
Thank you .
( Applause )
There &apos;s a man by the name of Cap@@ tain Willi@@ am Sw@@ en@@ son who recently was awar@@ ded the con@@ gres@@ sional M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ on@@ or for his actions on Sep@@ tem@@ ber 8 , 2009 .
On that day , a colum@@ n of American and Af@@ g@@ han tro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government of@@ fici@@ als , a group of Af@@ g@@ han government of@@ fici@@ als , who would be meeting with some local village el@@ ders .
The colum@@ n came under am@@ bus@@ h , and was surro@@ unded on three sides , and am@@ ong@@ st many other things , Cap@@ tain Sw@@ en@@ son was recogni@@ zed for running into live fire to res@@ cu@@ e the w@@ oun@@ ded and pull out the dead .
One of the people he res@@ cu@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ ac heli@@ cop@@ ter .
And what was remarkable about this day is , by she@@ er co@@ incid@@ ence , one of the me@@ dev@@ ac medic@@ s happened to have a Go@@ P@@ ro camera on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tured the whole scene on camera .
It shows Cap@@ tain Sw@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de bringing this w@@ oun@@ ded soldi@@ er who had received a gun@@ shot to the nec@@ k .
They put him in the heli@@ cop@@ ter , and then you see Cap@@ tain Sw@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he turns around to res@@ cu@@ e more .
I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
What is that ? That is some deep , deep emo@@ tion , when you would want to do that .
There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?
You know , in the military , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are willing to sacri@@ fic@@ e themselves so that others may gain .
In business , we give bon@@ uses to people who are willing to sacri@@ fic@@ e others so that we may gain .
We have it back@@ wards . Right ?
So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
And my initi@@ al conclu@@ sion was that they &apos;re just better people .
These better people are at@@ trac@@ ted to this concept of service .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call hero@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooper@@ ation .
So trust and cooper@@ ation are really important here .
The problem with concep@@ ts of trust and cooper@@ ation is that they are feelings , they are not instruc@@ tions .
I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
I can &apos;t simply instruc@@ t two people to cooper@@ ate , and they will .
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
If you go back 5@@ 0,000 years to the P@@ ale@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic era , to the early days of Ho@@ mo sa@@ pi@@ ens , what we find is that the world was filled with dan@@ ger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
No@@ thing personal .
W@@ he@@ ther it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a sab@@ er-@@ to@@ o@@ th@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to reduce our lif@@ esp@@ an .
And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we bel@@ on@@ ged .
And when we felt safe am@@ ong@@ st our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooper@@ ation .
There are inher@@ ent benefits to this .
It means I can fall as@@ le@@ ep at night and trust that someone from within my tri@@ be will watch for dan@@ ger .
If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , that means you won &apos;t watch for dan@@ ger .
B@@ ad system of survival .
The modern day is exactly the same thing .
The world is filled with dan@@ ger , things that are trying to frustr@@ ate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
It could be the u@@ ps and dow@@ ns in the economy , the un@@ certain@@ ty of the st@@ ock market .
It could be a new technology that ren@@ ders your business model ob@@ sole@@ te over@@ night .
Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very mini@@ mum is working hard to frustr@@ ate your growth and ste@@ al your business from you .
We have no control over these forces .
These are a const@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away .
The only vari@@ able are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the t@@ one .
When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacri@@ fic@@ e their comfor@@ ts and sacri@@ fic@@ e the tan@@ gible results , so that the people re@@ main and feel safe and feel like they bel@@ ong , remarkable things happen .
I was flying on a trip , and I was wit@@ ness to an incid@@ ent where a pas@@ sen@@ ger attemp@@ ted to board before their number was called , and I watched the gate ag@@ ent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
He was yel@@ led at for attemp@@ ting to board one group too soon .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cat@@ tle ?
Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
She said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
The reason we like flying Sou@@ th@@ west Air@@ lines is not because they necessarily hi@@ re better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expen@@ d our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inher@@ ently we@@ ak@@ ens the organization .
When we feel safe inside the organization , we will natur@@ ally comb@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our streng@@ ths and work ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to face the d@@ angers outside and se@@ ize the opportunities .
The clo@@ s@@ est analog@@ y I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a par@@ ent .
If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?
We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipl@@ ine them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
They want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipl@@ ine when necessary , build their self-@@ confid@@ ence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
Char@@ lie Ki@@ m , who &apos;s the CE@@ O of a company called N@@ ext Ju@@ mp in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider l@@ aying off one of your children ?
We would never do it .
Then why do we consider l@@ aying off people inside our organization ?
Char@@ lie implement@@ ed a policy of lifetime employ@@ ment .
If you get a job at N@@ ext Ju@@ mp , you cannot get fi@@ red for performance issues .
In fact , if you have issues , they will co@@ ach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
It &apos;s the complete opposite .
This is the reason so many people have such a vis@@ cer@@ al hat@@ red , anger , at some of these ban@@ king CE@@ O@@ s with their dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate sal@@ aries and bon@@ us structures .
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very definition of leadership .
They have viol@@ ated this deep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social contr@@ act .
We know that they allowed their people to be sacri@@ fic@@ ed so they could protect their own interest@@ s , or worse , they sacri@@ fic@@ ed their people to protect their own interest@@ s .
This is what so off@@ ends us , not the numbers .
Would anybody be of@@ fen@@ ded if we gave a $ 150 million bon@@ us to G@@ and@@ hi ?
How about a $ 250 million bon@@ us to M@@ other Ter@@ esa ?
Do we have an issue with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Great leaders would never sacri@@ fic@@ e
the people to save the numbers .
They would so@@ on@@ er sacri@@ fic@@ e the numbers to save the people .
Bo@@ b C@@ hap@@ man , who run@@ s a large manufactur@@ ing company in the Mid@@ west called B@@ arr@@ y-@@ We@@ h@@ mill@@ er , in 2008 was hit very hard by the rec@@ es@@ sion , and they lost 30 percent of their orders over@@ night .
Now in a large manufactur@@ ing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor po@@ ol .
They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discus@@ sed lay@@ off@@ s .
And Bo@@ b re@@ f@@ used .
You see , Bo@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts .
Bo@@ b believ@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
And so they came up with a fur@@ l@@ ough program .
Every employ@@ ee , from secre@@ tary to CE@@ O , was required to take four weeks of un@@ paid vac@@ ation .
They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecu@@ tiv@@ ely .
But it was how Bo@@ b announ@@ ced the program that mat@@ tered so much .
He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suf@@ fer a little than any of us should have to suf@@ fer a lot , and mor@@ ale went up .
They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and prot@@ ected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooper@@ ate .
And quite spon@@ tane@@ ously , nobody expected , people started tr@@ ading with each other .
Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
Le@@ ad@@ ership is a choice . It is not a r@@ ank .
I know many people at the sen@@ i@@ or@@ most levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
They are auth@@ ori@@ ties , and we do what they say because they have auth@@ ority over us , but we would not follow them .
And I know many people who are at the bot@@ tom@@ s of organizations who have no auth@@ ority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the left of them , and they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the right of them .
This is what a leader is .
I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in theater , and as is the Mar@@ ine cust@@ om , the offic@@ er ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders because they go first .
We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
We call them leaders because they will choose to sacri@@ fic@@ e so that their people may be safe and prot@@ ected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacri@@ fic@@ e for us .
They will give us their blood and swe@@ at and t@@ ears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why would you give your blood and swe@@ at and t@@ ears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
The most complex problems in our time can be sol@@ ved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to c@@ ross from dreams to reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ru@@ th T@@ ic@@ ha@@ u@@ er , a Je@@ wish refuge@@ e that sett@@ led in the heart of the An@@ des .
That is how I grew up : encour@@ aged to see beyond any limit@@ ation .
So part of my education inclu@@ ded helping her in remote , indi@@ gen@@ ous communities .
I ch@@ er@@ ish those mem@@ ories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barri@@ ers , as language or culture .
Dur@@ ing those tri@@ ps , my grandmother used to reci@@ te a Ki@@ pl@@ ing po@@ em : &quot; &quot; Some@@ thing hidden . Go and find it .
Go and look behind the Moun@@ tains .
Some@@ thing lost behind the moun@@ tains .
Lo@@ st and waiting for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medical student .
One of every hundred children born world@@ wide has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem starts during pregn@@ ancy .
The fe@@ tus needs to survive inside the mother .
S@@ ur@@ viv@@ al depen@@ ds on communication between the syst@@ em@@ ic and the pul@@ mon@@ ary blood .
At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
If it doesn &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
It is caused by pre@@ mat@@ urity and genetic conditions .
But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
As you can see in the char@@ t , the frequ@@ ency of this kind of hole dram@@ atically incre@@ ases with al@@ titude .
Video : ( Bab@@ y cr@@ ying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they seem desper@@ ate to brea@@ the .
To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
One night , my friend Mal@@ te , were cam@@ ping in the Amazon region .
The only thing that would not bur@@ n in the fire was a green av@@ oc@@ ado bran@@ ch .
Then came a moment of inspir@@ ation .
So we used the bran@@ ch as a mo@@ ld for our first inven@@ tion .
The holes in children &apos;s hear@@ ts can be closed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of wi@@ re wr@@ apped onto itself .
It maybe doesn &apos;t look so f@@ ancy to you now , but that was our first successful attemp@@ t to create a device for this major problem .
In this video , we can see how a very tiny ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart .
The co@@ il then clo@@ ses the hole .
After that moment of inspir@@ ation , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototy@@ pe .
In vi@@ tro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
The co@@ il , if it works , can save lives .
I re@@ turned from Germany to Bo@@ li@@ via , thinking that wher@@ ever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
With my wife and partner , Dr. Alex@@ and@@ ra He@@ ath , we started to see patients .
After success@@ fully tre@@ ating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ th@@ usi@@ astic .
The hole in al@@ titude patients is different , because the ori@@ fic@@ e between the ar@@ teri@@ es is larger .
Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time , and they die .
The first co@@ il could success@@ fully treat only half of the patients in Bo@@ li@@ via .
The search started again .
We went back to the drawing board .
After many tri@@ als , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous friends in the moun@@ tains , we ob@@ tain@@ ed a new device .
We take this traditional method of we@@ aving and make a design made by a smart material that recor@@ ds shape .
It seems this time , the we@@ aving allows us to create a se@@ am@@ less device that doesn &apos;t r@@ ust because it &apos;s made of only one piece .
It can change by itself into very complex structures by a proced@@ ure that took decades to develop .
As you can see , the device ent@@ ers the body through the natural chan@@ n@@ els .
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the hole .
Our device expan@@ ds , places itself and clo@@ ses the hole .
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open surgery was necessary .
This is the child from before , after the proced@@ ure .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent heal@@ ed .
From start to finish , the whole proced@@ ure takes only 30 minutes .
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medical and human point of view .
We are so proud that some of our form@@ er patients are part of our team — a team , th@@ anks to ad@@ ded close interaction with patients that work with us .
To@@ gether , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
We lost the fear of creating something new .
The path , it &apos;s not easy .
Many obst@@ ac@@ les ari@@ se all the time .
But we recei@@ ve streng@@ th from our patients .
Their resili@@ ence and cour@@ age inspi@@ re our creativity .
Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
So we have to start a foundation with a one-@@ to-@@ one model .
We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
We are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
Muchas gracias .

So I grew up in L@@ im@@ po@@ po , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ po@@ po and M@@ pu@@ mal@@ an@@ ga , a little town called M@@ ot@@ et@@ ema .
W@@ ater and electricity supply are as un@@ predic@@ table as the weather , and growing up in these tough situ@@ ations , at the age of 17 , I was rel@@ ax@@ ing with a couple of friends of mine in win@@ ter , and we were sun@@ ba@@ thing .
The L@@ im@@ po@@ po sun gets really hot in win@@ ter .
So as we were sun@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sho@@ c@@ king statistics .
Over 2.@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per access to water and sanit@@ ation .
F@@ our hundred and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
V@@ ari@@ ous diseases thri@@ ve in this environment , the most dr@@ astic of which is called trac@@ ho@@ ma .
Tr@@ ac@@ ho@@ ma is an inf@@ ection of the eye due to dir@@ t getting into your eye . M@@ ulti@@ ple infec@@ tions of trac@@ ho@@ ma can leave you perman@@ ently blind .
The disease leaves eight million people perman@@ ently blind each and every year . The sho@@ c@@ king part about it is that to avoid being inf@@ ected with trac@@ ho@@ ma , all you have to do is was@@ h your face : no medicine , no pi@@ lls , no inj@@ ec@@ tions .
So after seeing these sho@@ c@@ king statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tr@@ ust@@ y little ste@@ ed , my No@@ k@@ ia 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20@@ -@@ r@@ and-@@ an-@@ hour Internet caf@@ e — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lo@@ tions , cre@@ ams , the com@@ posi@@ tions , the mel@@ ting points , the toxi@@ cities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little for@@ mula on a piece of paper ,
and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C special sp@@ ice , you know ?
So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the for@@ mula ready .
Now we need to get this thing into practice .
F@@ ast forward four years later , after having written a 4@@ 0-@@ page business plan on the cell phone , having written my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ g@@ est pat@@ ent@@ -@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first ba@@ th-@@ sub@@ stitu@@ ting lo@@ tion .
You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the .
( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully func@@ tion@@ ing product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
So we learned a few les@@ sons in commer@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath available .
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bul@@ k .
They buy products on demand . A person in Ale@@ x doesn &apos;t buy a box of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes . They buy one ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
So we pack@@ aged D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these innov@@ ative little s@@ ach@@ ets .
You just sn@@ ap them in half , and you s@@ que@@ e@@ ze it out .
And the cool part is , one s@@ ach@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ tes one b@@ ath for five r@@ and .
After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implement@@ ing the product .
We realized that even rich kids from the sub@@ urb@@ s really want D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Any@@ way , we realized that we could save 80 million li@@ ters of water on average each time they s@@ ki@@ pped a b@@ ath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for home@@ work , two hours more to just be a kid .
After seeing that global impact , we n@@ arro@@ wed it down to our key value pro@@ position , which was clean@@ lin@@ ess and conveni@@ ence .
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a rich man &apos;s conveni@@ ence and a poor man &apos;s lif@@ es@@ a@@ ver .
H@@ aving put the product into practice , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of selling the product onto a mul@@ tin@@ ational to take it to the re@@ tail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the grav@@ el roads of L@@ im@@ po@@ po , with an al@@ low@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the .
What &apos;s stop@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young minds in the world .
I &apos;m also currently the best student entreprene@@ ur in the world , the first African to get that ac@@ col@@ ade , and one thing that really puzz@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you .
( Applause . )
Fi@@ ve years ago , I was on a sab@@ b@@ ati@@ c@@ al , and I re@@ turned to the medical university where I studied .
I saw real patients and I wor@@ e the white co@@ at for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consul@@ t@@ ant .
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
The first one was that the common them@@ e of the discus@@ sions we had were hospital bud@@ gets and cost@@ -@@ cu@@ tting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , form@@ er friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most motiv@@ ated , eng@@ aged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ n@@ ical , dis@@ eng@@ aged , or had dist@@ anced themselves from hospital management .
So with this focus on cost@@ -@@ cu@@ tting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the patient ?
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bud@@ gets .
And many different re@@ forms aim at holding back this growth .
In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
In other countries , new drugs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
In several countries , doctors and nur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ext@@ ent , for the governments .
After all , the cost@@ ly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nur@@ ses .
You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to oper@@ ate on an old and f@@ ra@@ il patient .
So , by limit@@ ing the degrees of freedom of physici@@ ans , this is a way to hold costs down .
And ultimately , some physici@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liber@@ ty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustr@@ ated .
At B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ aging heal@@ th@@ care .
And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
U@@ lti@@ mately , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re aim@@ ing at impro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or af@@ for@@ d@@ able , cost .
We call this valu@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : out@@ comes that matter to patients rel@@ ative to the money we spend .
This was described beauti@@ fully in a book in 2006 by Michael Por@@ ter and E@@ liz@@ ab@@ eth Te@@ is@@ berg .
On this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law surro@@ unded by his three beautiful dau@@ gh@@ ters .
When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascin@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw .
You compare hospit@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are v@@ ast@@ ly much worse .
The differences were dram@@ atic .
Eri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , he suffer@@ s from pro@@ state cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-@@ repu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system .
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming in@@ continent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing di@@ a@@ pers again .
You fli@@ p a co@@ in . Fi@@ f@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a cl@@ ini@@ c called the Mar@@ t@@ ini@@ -@@ K@@ l@@ ini@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 .
E@@ i@@ ther you a fli@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ fold difference .
When we look at many hospit@@ als for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
No@@ body knows .
So going the hospital is a lot@@ tery .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
In the late &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ dis@@ h or@@ th@@ o@@ pedi@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ nu@@ al meeting , and they were discus@@ sing the different proced@@ ures they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p surgery .
To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p .
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
They all argu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My techni@@ que is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they ad@@ mit@@ ted that .
So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years deb@@ ating , &quot; So what is quality in hi@@ p surgery ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
And they finally agre@@ ed .
And once they had agre@@ ed , they started meas@@ uring , and started sharing the data .
Very quickly , they found that if you put c@@ ement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal sha@@ ft in , it actually l@@ ast@@ ed a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-@@ oper@@ ated on in their lifetime .
They published the data , and it actually transform@@ ed clinical practice in the country .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publi@@ sh every year .
Once a year , they publi@@ sh the le@@ agu@@ e table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continu@@ ous cycle of impro@@ vement .
For many years , S@@ we@@ dis@@ h hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were meas@@ uring , and many were not .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
So the physici@@ ans get together , they agree on what quality is , they start meas@@ uring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ vement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the low@@ est costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
So if you look at the hi@@ p surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sw@@ eden .
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first surgery .
In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sw@@ eden .
So many un@@ necessary surg@@ eries , and so much un@@ necessary suffering for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year period .
Now , you can imagine how much sav@@ ings there would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the mem@@ ber countries .
The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in O@@ E@@ C@@ D .
Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would focus a lot more on meas@@ uring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the heal@@ th@@ care budget of the country .
Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
This would be a paradig@@ m shift in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
The ag@@ ents of change are the doctors and nur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
In my practice as a consul@@ t@@ ant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nur@@ ses and other hospital or heal@@ th@@ care st@@ af@@ f every year .
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
P@@ hy@@ sici@@ ans are , like most of you in the audience , very competi@@ tive .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
And if somebody can show them that the result they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physici@@ ans have another character@@ istic .
They actually thri@@ ve from pe@@ er recogni@@ tion .
If a cardi@@ olog@@ ist calls another cardi@@ olog@@ ist in a compe@@ ting hospital and discus@@ ses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
They will share the information on how to improve .
So it is , by meas@@ uring and creating transpar@@ ency , you get a cycle of continu@@ ous impro@@ vement , which is what this slide shows .
Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
This is happening in reality .
We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
To@@ gether with two academ@@ ic institutions , Michael Por@@ ter at Harvard Bus@@ iness School , and the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a Institute in Sw@@ eden , B@@ C@@ G has formed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M .
You may think that &apos;s a s@@ ne@@ e@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ ne@@ e@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ r@@ on@@ y@@ m .
It st@@ ands for the Inter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for He@@ alth O@@ u@@ t@@ come M@@ eas@@ u@@ rement .
We &apos;re bringing together leading physici@@ ans and patients to discu@@ ss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those stand@@ ards global .
They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cat@@ ar@@ acts , back pain , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and pro@@ state cancer .
The four groups will publi@@ sh their data in No@@ v@@ ember of this year .
That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be compar@@ ing ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples , not only within a country , but between countries .
N@@ ext year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den .
Com@@ par@@ e ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
Fi@@ ve months ago , I led a work@@ shop at the largest university hospital in Nor@@ thern Europe .
They have a new CE@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institu@@ tion much more on quality , out@@ comes that matter to patients .
This particular day , we sat in a work@@ shop together with physici@@ ans , nur@@ ses and other st@@ af@@ f , discus@@ sing le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia in children .
The group discus@@ sed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
We discus@@ sed , how do we treat these kids , what are important impro@@ v@@ ements ?
And we discus@@ sed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more effici@@ ently ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ usias@@ m .
At the end of the meeting , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ partment , he stood up .
He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I for@@ got that — he raised his hand , cl@@ en@@ ched his fi@@ st , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discus@@ sing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By meas@@ uring value in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only costs but out@@ comes that matter to patients , we will make st@@ af@@ f in hospit@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
I believe meas@@ uring value in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the foun@@ der of modern medicine , the Gre@@ ek Hi@@ p@@ po@@ cr@@ ates , who always put the patient at the center , he would s@@ mile in his gr@@ ave .
Thank you .
( Applause )
You get them to achieve un@@ believ@@ able things .
We learned a lot from those fail@@ ures .
So much about a team &apos;s execu@@ tion is its ability to adap@@ t to getting pun@@ ched in the face by the cust@@ om@@ er .
The cust@@ om@@ er is the true reality .
Then I started looking at the business model .

I &apos;d done well at school . Ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully enter@@ ed the student life of lec@@ tures , parti@@ es and traffic con@@ e the@@ ft .
Un@@ der@@ neath , I was actually deeply un@@ happy , in@@ sec@@ ure and fundament@@ ally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emp@@ t@@ iness that I felt was within me .
I was leaving a sem@@ in@@ ar when it started , hu@@ m@@ ming to myself , fu@@ m@@ bling with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly obser@@ ve , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able .
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
And the voice per@@ sist@@ ed , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narr@@ ating everything I did in the third person .
&quot; She is going to a lec@@ ture . &quot;
It was neutr@@ al , im@@ pas@@ sive and even , after a while , str@@ ang@@ ely compani@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , although I did notice that its cal@@ m exterior sometimes sli@@ pped and that it oc@@ c@@ asion@@ ally mir@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ expres@@ sed emo@@ tion .
So , for example , if I was an@@ gry and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very ad@@ ept at con@@ ce@@ aling how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustr@@ ated .
A sub@@ tle condi@@ tion@@ ing process had be@@ gun , the implic@@ ation that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
I spent some time telling the college G@@ .@@ P@@ .
And to be fair , I was desper@@ ate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange com@@ ment@@ ator .
For example , I was part of a student TV station that broad@@ cas@@ t news bu@@ lle@@ t@@ ins around the cam@@ pus , and during an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
It was at this point that events began to rapi@@ dly over@@ take me .
A hospital ad@@ mission followed , the first of many , a diagnos@@ is of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxi@@ c , tor@@ ment@@ ing sense of ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ness , hu@@ mili@@ ation and des@@ pair about myself and my pro@@ sp@@ ects .
But having been encour@@ aged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symp@@ tom , my fear and resist@@ ance towards it intensi@@ fied .
Now essentially , this represent@@ ed taking an ag@@ gres@@ sive st@@ ance towards my own mind , a kind of psy@@ ch@@ ic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progres@@ sively ho@@ sti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing .
You see that glass of water ?
In effect , a vi@@ cious cycle of fear , avo@@ id@@ ance , mi@@ str@@ ust and mis@@ understanding had been establi@@ shed , and this was a b@@ attle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ capable of establi@@ sh@@ ing any kind of peace or re@@ conci@@ li@@ ation .
Two years later , and the de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation was dram@@ atic .
By now , I had the whole fr@@ enz@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ toi@@ re : terri@@ fying voices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que visi@@ ons , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , intr@@ act@@ able del@@ u@@ sions .
Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age and des@@ pair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
A broken and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that journey , but the person who emerg@@ ed was a surviv@@ or and would ultimately grow into the person I was dest@@ ined to be .
Many people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the mem@@ ories grow pal@@ e and f@@ ain@@ t in compar@@ ison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
Sometimes , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as late as M@@ ay , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ought with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to wel@@ come me back from that ag@@ oniz@@ ed , lon@@ ely place .
Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so ho@@ sti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metap@@ hor@@ ical meaning from what I &apos;d previ@@ ously interpre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al truth .
So for example , voices which thre@@ aten@@ ed to attack my home I learned to interpre@@ t as my own sense of fear and in@@ security in the world , rather than an actual , obj@@ ective dan@@ ger .
Now at first , I would have believed them .
I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genu@@ ine threat from the voices .
It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t m@@ ess with me .
I &apos;ve got a plastic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ trat@@ egi@@ c .
It was arm@@ ed with this knowledge that ultimately I would ga@@ ther together my s@@ hat@@ tered self , each frag@@ ment represent@@ ed by a different voice , grad@@ ually with@@ draw from all my medic@@ ation , and return to psy@@ chi@@ a@@ try , only this time from the other side .
I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Inter@@ voice , the organiz@@ ational body of the Inter@@ national H@@ earing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement , an initi@@ ative inspired by the work of Pro@@ f@@ essor M@@ ari@@ us R@@ om@@ me and Dr. S@@ and@@ ra Es@@ ch@@ er , which loc@@ ates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a san@@ e reaction to in@@ san@@ e circum@@ st@@ ances , not as an ab@@ err@@ ant symp@@ tom of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia to be en@@ du@@ red , but a complex , significant and mean@@ ing@@ ful experience to be explo@@ red .
This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
To par@@ ap@@ h@@ rase Cha@@ vez , once social change begins , it cannot be rever@@ sed .
You cannot hu@@ mili@@ ate the person who feels pri@@ de .
You cannot op@@ press the people who are not afraid anymore .
In the last 20 years , the H@@ earing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement has establi@@ shed hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five contin@@ ents , working together to promot@@ e dig@@ n@@ ity , soli@@ dar@@ ity and em@@ power@@ ment for individuals in mental distr@@ ess , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an un@@ sha@@ k@@ able belief in the power of the individual .
As Pe@@ ter L@@ ev@@ ine has said , the human animal is a unique being en@@ do@@ wed with an inst@@ inc@@ tual capacity to he@@ al and the intellec@@ tual spirit to har@@ ness this in@@ n@@ ate capacity .
In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privile@@ ge than facili@@ t@@ ating that process of heal@@ ing for someone , to bear wit@@ ness , to reach out a hand , to share the bur@@ den of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their reco@@ very .
We are unique . We are ir@@ re@@ pl@@ ace@@ able .
What lies within us can never be truly col@@ oniz@@ ed , cont@@ or@@ ted , or taken away .
The light never goes out .
As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
T@@ ell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
Or is it photograph@@ y ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mi@@ xed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
So to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
Ph@@ ot@@ os like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y road .
But it has an un@@ expected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it re@@ tains a level of real@@ ism .
Or photos like these — both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of real@@ ism .
When I say real@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ real@@ ism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
Ph@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the tr@@ ick .
So it &apos;s more about captur@@ ing an idea than about captur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tr@@ ick that makes it look real@@ istic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illu@@ sion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illu@@ sion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is real@@ istic , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ istic really .
So I think the basi@@ c@@ s are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create altern@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imagin@@ able physical objects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
But comb@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we tr@@ ick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with comb@@ ining photograph@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different reali@@ ties .
So the things that make a photograph look real@@ istic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when comb@@ ining photograph@@ s , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a real@@ istic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But comb@@ ined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos comb@@ ined should have the same perspective .
Secon@@ dly , photos comb@@ ined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments — shot at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
So by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hic def@@ ects like de@@ p@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of lay@@ ers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipul@@ ated .
But this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photograph@@ s from different loc@@ ations .
I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromi@@ se with the ideas in your head .
But it does requi@@ re a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the pieces of the puzz@@ le basically .
So for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fish@@ ing trip .
The shor@@ es are from a different location .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h .
So to achieve a real@@ istic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photograph@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
And if you do a good job captur@@ ing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ istic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imagination .
Thank you .

The release of these papers from P@@ an@@ ama lif@@ ts the ve@@ il on a tiny piece of the secre@@ tive off@@ shor@@ e world .
We get an insi@@ ght into how cli@@ ents and ban@@ ks and law@@ y@@ ers go to companies like M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; &quot; OK , we want an an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous company , can you give us one ? &quot; &quot; So you actually get to see the em@@ ails , you get to see the ex@@ changes of mess@@ ages , you get to see the mechan@@ ics of how this works , how this oper@@ ates .
Now , this has already started to have pretty immedi@@ ate re@@ per@@ cu@@ s@@ sions .
The Pri@@ me Min@@ ister of I@@ cel@@ and has res@@ ig@@ ned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the bru@@ tal Sy@@ ri@@ an dic@@ t@@ ator B@@ as@@ har Al@@ -@@ As@@ sad has also got off@@ shor@@ e companies .
There &apos;s been al@@ leg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tr@@ ail that leads back to President V@@ la@@ di@@ mir Pu@@ ti@@ n of Rus@@ sia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cel@@ list .
And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of le@@ a@@ ked docu@@ ments .
Now , this sounds like the pl@@ ot of a sp@@ y thri@@ ll@@ er or a John G@@ ris@@ ham no@@ vel .
It seems very dist@@ ant from you , me , ordinary people .
Why should we care about this ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money off@@ shor@@ e and not pay the ta@@ xes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like heal@@ th@@ care , education , roads .
And that aff@@ ects all of us .
Now , for my organization Global W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been phenomen@@ al .
We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use off@@ shor@@ e sec@@ rec@@ y to hi@@ de and dis@@ gui@@ se their as@@ sets — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a decade .
Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world b@@ af@@ fl@@ ing and conf@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ shor@@ e world works .
I like to think of it a bit like a Rus@@ sian do@@ ll .
So you can have one company st@@ acked inside another company , st@@ acked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
It can be very difficult for law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement or ta@@ x auth@@ ori@@ ties , journ@@ alists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less co@@ ver@@ age of this issue in the United States .
And that &apos;s perhaps because some pro@@ min@@ ent U@@ S people just haven &apos;t figured in this ex@@ pos@@ é , in this sc@@ and@@ al .
Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are st@@ ash@@ ing their as@@ sets off@@ shor@@ e .
It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ shor@@ e works , M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a has fe@@ wer American cli@@ ents .
I think if we saw le@@ aks from the C@@ ay@@ man Is@@ lands or even from Del@@ aware or W@@ y@@ om@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ ada , you would see many more cases and examples lin@@ king back to Americans .
In fact , in a number of U@@ S states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a libr@@ ary card .
It has allowed s@@ cam@@ mers to ri@@ p off vulnerable invest@@ ors .
This is the sort of behavior that aff@@ ects all of us .
Now , at Global W@@ it@@ ness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we sent in an under@@ cover investig@@ ator to 13 Manhattan law fir@@ ms .
Our investig@@ ator posed as an African min@@ ister who wanted to move sus@@ p@@ ect fun@@ ds into the United States to buy a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a j@@ et .
Now , what was truly sho@@ c@@ king was that all but one of those law@@ y@@ ers provi@@ ded our investig@@ ator with sugg@@ esti@@ ons on how to move those sus@@ p@@ ect fun@@ ds .
These were all pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary me@@ et@@ ings , and none of the law@@ y@@ ers took us on as a cli@@ ent and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system .
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
This is not just about an individual law@@ yer who &apos;s spo@@ ken to our under@@ cover investig@@ ator and provi@@ ded sugg@@ esti@@ ons .
It &apos;s not just about a particular sen@@ ior politici@@ an who &apos;s been caught up in a sc@@ and@@ al .
This is about how a system works , that entren@@ ches corruption , ta@@ x ev@@ asi@@ on , poverty and inst@@ ability .
And in order to t@@ ack@@ le this , we need to change the game .
We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder .
This may seem like do@@ om and g@@ loo@@ m , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be rich and powerful individuals .
But as a natural optimi@@ st , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
This issue was put on the political agenda by the U@@ K Pri@@ me Min@@ ister David Cam@@ eron at a big G@@ 8 Su@@ m@@ mit that was held in Nor@@ thern I@@ rel@@ and in 20@@ 13 .
And since then , the European Uni@@ on is going to be creating central regi@@ sters at a national level of who really ow@@ ns and contr@@ ols companies across Europe .
One of the things that is sad is that , actually , the U@@ S is l@@ ag@@ ging behind .
There &apos;s bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an legisl@@ ation that had been introduc@@ ed in the H@@ ouse and the Sen@@ ate , but it isn &apos;t making as much progress as we &apos;d like to see .
So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ ama le@@ aks , this huge pe@@ ek into the off@@ shor@@ e world , be used as a way of opening up in the U@@ S and around the world .
For us at Global W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
We need ordinary people to get an@@ gry at the way in which people can hi@@ de their identity behind secret companies .
We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Sec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to comm@@ it to changing the law to open up this sort of sec@@ rec@@ y .
To@@ gether , we can end the sec@@ rec@@ y that is currently allo@@ wing ta@@ x ev@@ asi@@ on , corruption , money la@@ under@@ ing to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh .
Chris Anderson : Ju@@ li@@ an , wel@@ come .
It &apos;s been report@@ ed that Wiki@@ Le@@ aks , your baby , has , in the last few years has rele@@ ased more clas@@ si@@ fied docu@@ ments than the rest of the world &apos;s media comb@@ ined .
Can that possibly be true ?
Ju@@ li@@ an As@@ san@@ ge : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activi@@ sts is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press comb@@ ined .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people release the docu@@ ments ?
And how do you sec@@ ure their privacy ?
J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — clas@@ sical wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
So we use this stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion to bo@@ un@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ ils , pass it through legal jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions like Sw@@ eden and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those legal prot@@ ec@@ tions .
We get information in the ma@@ il , the regular pos@@ tal ma@@ il , en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a regular news organization , form@@ at it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant dat@@ ab@@ ases of information — release it to the public and then def@@ end ourselves against the inevitable legal and political att@@ acks .
CA : So you make an effort to en@@ sure the docu@@ ments are le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
J@@ A : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rar@@ ely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we des@@ tr@@ oy that information as soon as possible .
( Ph@@ one ring ) God dam@@ n it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A asking what the code is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
This is something you le@@ a@@ ked a few years ago .
If we can have this docu@@ ment up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you le@@ a@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ roll Re@@ port .
This was a secret intelligence report com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed by the Ken@@ yan government after its elec@@ tion in 2004 .
Pri@@ or to 2004 , Kenya was r@@ ul@@ ed by D@@ ani@@ el ar@@ ap Mo@@ i for about 18 years .
He was a soft dic@@ t@@ ator of Kenya .
And when Ki@@ b@@ ak@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
And then the government sat on it and used it for political le@@ ver@@ age on Mo@@ i , who was the r@@ ich@@ est man — still is the r@@ ich@@ est man — in Kenya .
It &apos;s the Ho@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of Ken@@ yan journ@@ alism .
So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the national elec@@ tion , Dec@@ ember 28 .
When we rele@@ ased that report , we did so three days after the new president , Ki@@ b@@ ak@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to clean out , D@@ ani@@ el ar@@ ap Mo@@ i , so this report then became a dead al@@ b@@ atr@@ os@@ s around President Ki@@ b@@ ak@@ i &apos;s nec@@ k .
CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report le@@ a@@ ked into Kenya , not from the of@@ ficial media , but in@@ directly , and in your opini@@ on , it actually shif@@ ted the elec@@ tion .
J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front page of the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the surro@@ un@@ ding countries of Kenya , in T@@ anz@@ ani@@ an and South African press .
And so it came in from the outside .
And that , after a couple of days , made the Ken@@ yan press feel safe to talk about it .
And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts straight on Ken@@ yan TV , shif@@ ted the vote by 10 percent , ac@@ cording to a Ken@@ yan intelligence report , which changed the result of the elec@@ tion .
CA : Wow , so your le@@ ak really subst@@ anti@@ ally changed the world ?
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Ba@@ gh@@ dad air@@ stri@@ ke video .
The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
This is — this is inten@@ se material , I should war@@ n you .
R@@ adi@@ o : ... just fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
I see your el@@ ement , u@@ h , got about four Hu@@ m@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ...
You &apos;re clear . All right . Fir@@ ing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s sho@@ ot .
Li@@ ght &apos; em all up .
C &apos;@@ m@@ on , fire !
( M@@ ach@@ ine gun fire ) Ke@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n . Ke@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n . ( M@@ ach@@ ine gun fire ) Ke@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n .
H@@ ot@@ el ... B@@ ush@@ master Tw@@ o-@@ Si@@ x , B@@ ush@@ master Tw@@ o-@@ Si@@ x ,
we need to move , time now !
All right , we just eng@@ aged all eight individuals .
Yeah , we see two birds &#91; heli@@ cop@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing .
Ro@@ ger . I got &apos; em .
Tw@@ o-@@ Si@@ x , this is Tw@@ o-@@ Si@@ x , we &apos;re mobile .
O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
God dam@@ n it , K@@ yle . All right , ha@@ ha@@ ha . I hit &apos; em .
CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
J@@ A : The impact on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We ended up sending two people to Ba@@ gh@@ dad to further research that story .
So this is just the first of three att@@ acks that occur@@ red in that scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Re@@ u@@ ters employees ?
J@@ A : Yeah . Two Re@@ u@@ ters employees , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded .
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
CA : And rele@@ as@@ ing this caused wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tr@@ age .
What was the key el@@ ement of this that actually caused the ou@@ tr@@ age , do you think ?
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gro@@ ss dispar@@ ity in force .
You have guys walking in a rel@@ ax@@ ed way down the street , and then an Ap@@ ac@@ he heli@@ cop@@ ter sitting up at one kilo@@ meter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0-@@ milli@@ meter can@@ n@@ on shel@@ ls on everyone — looking for any ex@@ cu@@ se to do so — and killing people res@@ cu@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded .
And there was two journ@@ alists involved that clearly weren &apos;t in@@ surg@@ ents because that &apos;s their fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time job .
CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analy@@ st , Br@@ ad@@ ley Man@@ ning , arr@@ ested , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he conf@@ essed in a c@@ hat room to have le@@ a@@ ked this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 clas@@ si@@ fied U.S. em@@ bas@@ sy cables .
I mean , did he ?
J@@ A : We have den@@ i@@ ed recei@@ ving those cables .
He has been char@@ ged , about five days ago , with ob@@ tain@@ ing 15@@ 0,000 cables and rele@@ as@@ ing 50 .
Now , we had rele@@ ased , early in the year , a cable from the Re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k U.S. em@@ bas@@ sy , but this is not necessarily connected .
I mean , I was a known visi@@ tor of that em@@ bas@@ sy .
CA : I mean , if you did recei@@ ve thousands of U.S. em@@ bas@@ sy di@@ plo@@ matic cables ...
J@@ A : We would have rele@@ ased them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things reve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b governments are like , the true human@@ -@@ rights ab@@ uses in those governments .
If you look at dec@@ las@@ si@@ fied cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broad@@ ly about this .
I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosoph@@ y ?
Why is it right to encour@@ age le@@ aking of secret information ?
J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve re@@ form .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So information that organizations are spending economic effort into con@@ ce@@ aling , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to con@@ ce@@ al it .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journ@@ alism is .
CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where le@@ aking can actually have an un@@ inten@@ ded consequ@@ ence ?
J@@ A : Not that we have seen with anything we have rele@@ ased .
I mean , we have a har@@ m immun@@ ization policy .
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — person@@ ally identi@@ fying information in it .
But there are le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate secre@@ ts — you know , your recor@@ ds with your doctor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate secret — but we deal with wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-@@ motiv@@ ated .
CA : So they are well-@@ motiv@@ ated .
And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone whose son is out ser@@ ving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an inc@@ enti@@ ve to put out .
It shows a U.S. soldi@@ er laugh@@ ing at people dying .
That gives the impres@@ sion , has given the impres@@ sion , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldi@@ ers are in@@ human people .
Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
But remember , the people in Ba@@ gh@@ dad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their opini@@ on . It &apos;s not going to change their percep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It will change the percep@@ tion and opini@@ on of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of dark secre@@ ts in companies and in government .
Li@@ ght is good .
But do you see any ir@@ ony in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sources ?
J@@ A : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any Wiki@@ Le@@ aks dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents yet .
We don &apos;t have sources who are dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents on other sources .
Sh@@ ould they come forward , that would be a tr@@ ick@@ y situation for us , but we &apos;re presu@@ m@@ ably acting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ el@@ led to continue our mission , not to scre@@ w it up .
CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opini@@ on in the TED audience .
You know , there might be a couple of views of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks and of Ju@@ li@@ an .
You know , h@@ ero — people &apos;s h@@ ero — bringing this important light .
D@@ an@@ ger@@ ous trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker .
Who &apos;s got the h@@ ero view ?
Who &apos;s got the dangerous trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker view ?
J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a soft crow@@ d , Ju@@ li@@ an , a soft crow@@ d .
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet le@@ a@@ ked , but I think for TED you are .
I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sam@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
So late last year — in No@@ v@@ ember last year — there was a series of well b@@ low@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of Mexico , but not quite as big .
And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guar@@ ds from some ri@@ val , various compe@@ ting oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked truc@@ ks there and blo@@ wn them up .
And part of the Al@@ ban@@ i@@ an government was in this , etc . , etc .
And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult docu@@ ment for us .
We couldn &apos;t veri@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of sk@@ ep@@ tical that maybe it was a compe@@ ting oil fir@@ m just sort of playing the issue up .
So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re sk@@ ep@@ tical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t veri@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , want@@ ing to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What docu@@ ment is it , preci@@ sely , you &apos;re talking about ?
Can you show that you had legal auth@@ ority over that docu@@ ment ?
Is it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the auth@@ or in the Microsoft Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
This is like one of our meth@@ ods of identi@@ fying , of veri@@ fying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside B@@ P ?
J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of serious fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and engineering effort .
So our public@@ ation rate over the past few months has been sort of mini@@ mi@@ zed while we &apos;re re-@@ engineering our back systems for the phenomen@@ al public interest that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organization , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous qu@@ anti@@ ty of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ sur@@ es of a very high cali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ k , basically journ@@ al@@ istic volunte@@ ers and / or the fun@@ ding of journ@@ al@@ istic sal@@ aries ?
J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tr@@ usted people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to res@@ truc@@ ture in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
CA : So help us understand a bit about you person@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 3@@ 7 different schools .
Can that be right ?
J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psycho@@ logist might say that &apos;s a reci@@ pe for bre@@ eding par@@ ano@@ ia .
J@@ A : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hac@@ ker at an early age and ran into the auth@@ ori@@ ties early on .
J@@ A : Well , I was a journ@@ alist .
You know , I was a very young journ@@ alist activi@@ st at an early age .
I wrote a magazine , was pro@@ secu@@ ted for it when I was a teen@@ ager .
So you have to be care@@ ful with hac@@ ker .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be depl@@ oy@@ ed for various things .
Un@@ fortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly depl@@ oy@@ ed by the Rus@@ sian ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your grandmother &apos;s bank accoun@@ ts .
So this ph@@ rase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ aling anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incid@@ ent in your life that helped determin@@ e them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the incid@@ ent .
But the core values : well , capable , gener@@ ous men do not create victims ; they nur@@ ture victims .
And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life .
CA : Cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create victims ; they nur@@ ture victims ?
J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a comb@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of nur@@ tur@@ ing victims , which is to police perpe@@ trat@@ ors of crime .
And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in I@@ cel@@ and ?
You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was in@@ jun@@ c@@ ted from running the story .
Instead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side .
That made you very high-@@ pro@@ file in I@@ cel@@ and . What happened next ?
J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
I@@ cel@@ and went through this financial crisis .
It was the har@@ dest hit of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
Any@@ way , so we release this report in Ju@@ ly last year .
And the national TV station was in@@ jun@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion land@@ ed on the news des@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a fi@@ ll@@ er , and we became very famous in I@@ cel@@ and , went to I@@ cel@@ and and spoke about this issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of pack@@ age of legisl@@ ation for I@@ cel@@ and to sort of become an off@@ shor@@ e haven for the free press , with the str@@ ong@@ est journ@@ al@@ istic prot@@ ec@@ tions in the world , with a new Nobel Pri@@ ze for freedom of speech .
I@@ cel@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system .
And just a month ago , this was passed by the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ anim@@ ously .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Ju@@ li@@ an .
When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Bro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us watching Big Bro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s enormous pres@@ sur@@ es to har@@ mon@@ ize freedom of speech legisl@@ ation and transpar@@ ency legisl@@ ation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U. , between China and the United States .
Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m refl@@ ecting the audience &apos;s opini@@ on to say , Ju@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you .
J@@ A : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that &apos;s gener@@ ally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 197@@ 5 , when I was seven years old , women in I@@ cel@@ and went on a stri@@ ke .
They did no work that day , whether they held professional jobs or had the work of the home .
They mar@@ ched into the center of Re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ í@@ k — 90 percent of women particip@@ ated — and pe@@ ace@@ fully and in soli@@ dar@@ ity asked for equality .
No@@ thing worked in I@@ cel@@ and that day , because nothing works when women are not at work .
I will never forget this day , that President V@@ ig@@ dí@@ s , as we know her by her first name , st@@ ep@@ ped out on the bal@@ con@@ y of her own home , a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won .
( Applause ) This woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time , including boys .
She frequ@@ ently sh@@ ares the story of how a young boy appro@@ ached her after a couple of terms in office and asked , &quot; &quot; Can boys really grow up to be president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ole models really matter , but even with such strong role models who I am so gr@@ at@@ eful for , when I was encour@@ aged to run for president , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I to run for president ?
Who am I to be president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men .
So a study done in the U@@ S in 2011 showed that 6@@ 2 percent of men had considered running for office , but 45 percent of women .
That &apos;s gap of 16 perc@@ ent@@ age points , and it &apos;s the same gap that exist@@ ed a decade earlier .
And it really is a sha@@ me , because I am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders and more princi@@ pl@@ e-@@ based leadership in general .
So my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit , even if I had no political experience , to step up and try to be part of creating the world that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids , and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls to be all they can be .
And it was the journey of my life .
It was amazing .
The journey started with potenti@@ ally as many as 20 candi@@ dat@@ es .
It bo@@ iled down to nine candi@@ dat@@ es qu@@ ali@@ fying , and ultimately the race came down to four of us , three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the dr@@ ama yet .
You may think you have dr@@ ama in the U@@ S , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can as@@ sure you we had our own dr@@ ama in I@@ cel@@ and .
So our sitting president of 20 years announ@@ ced initi@@ ally that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave rise to so many candi@@ dat@@ es consider@@ ing running .
Then later he changed his mind when our prime min@@ ister res@@ ig@@ ned following the inf@@ am@@ ous P@@ an@@ ama P@@ a@@ pers that implic@@ ated him and his family .
And there was a popular prot@@ est in I@@ cel@@ and , so the sitting president thought they needed a tr@@ usted leader .
A few days later , rel@@ ations to his wife and her family &apos;s companies were also discovered in the P@@ an@@ ama P@@ a@@ pers , and so he with@@ drew from the race again .
Be@@ fore doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two qu@@ ali@@ fied men who he felt could fill his shoes running for office .
So on M@@ ay 9 , 45 days before elec@@ tion day , it was not looking too good for me .
I did not even make the graph in the new@@ sp@@ aper .
The po@@ lls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the highest that any woman announ@@ c@@ ing her candi@@ d@@ acy had ear@@ ned .
So it would be an underst@@ at@@ ement to say that I had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table and access to television , because the network decided that they would only inclu@@ de those with 2.@@ 5 percent or more in the po@@ lls in the first TV debate .
I found out on the after@@ no@@ on of the first TV debate that I would particip@@ ate along with the three men , and I found out on live TV that I came in at exactly 2.@@ 5 percent on the day of the first TV debate .
( Applause ) So , challenges .
The fore@@ most challenges I had to face and over@@ come on this journey had to do with media , muscle and money .
Let &apos;s start with media .
There are those who say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
I can &apos;t say that I agree .
It pro@@ ved harder for me to both get access and air@@ time in media .
As a matter of fact , the leading candi@@ date appeared in broad@@ cas@@ t media 8@@ 7 times in the months leading up to the elec@@ tions , wher@@ eas I appeared 3@@ 1 times .
And I am not saying media is doing this consci@@ ously .
When I finally got access to TV , the first question I got was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to qu@@ it ? &quot; &quot; And that was a hard one .
But of course , with 1 percent to 2.@@ 5 percent in the po@@ lls , maybe it &apos;s underst@@ and@@ able .
But media really matters , and every time I appeared on TV , we saw and experienced a rise in the po@@ lls , so I know fir@@ s@@ th@@ and how much this matters and why we have to talk about it .
I was the only one out of the final four candi@@ dat@@ es that never got a front page inter@@ view .
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candi@@ dat@@ es and out of co@@ ver@@ age about the elec@@ tions .
So I did face this , but I will say this to compli@@ ment the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c media .
I got few if any com@@ ments about my hair and pant@@ suit .
( Applause ) So k@@ u@@ dos to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
I ran as an independent candi@@ date , not with any political party or muscle behind me .
That lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign , but it also allowed us to innov@@ ate and do politics differently .
We ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the t@@ one of the elec@@ tion for others by doing that .
It may be the reason why I had less air@@ time on TV , because I wanted to show other conten@@ ders respect .
When access to media pro@@ ved to be so difficult , we ran our own media .
I ran live Facebook ses@@ sions where I took questions from vot@@ ers on anything and respon@@ ded on the spot .
And we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook because we thought transpar@@ ency is important if you want to establi@@ sh trust .
And when re@@ aching young vot@@ ers pro@@ ved to be challen@@ ging , I became a S@@ n@@ ap@@ cha@@ tter .
I got young people to teach me how to do that , and I used every fil@@ ter on S@@ n@@ ap@@ c@@ hat during the last part of the campaign .
And I actually had to use a lot of humor and hu@@ mili@@ ty , as I was very bad at it .
But we grew the following am@@ ong@@ st young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different type of campaign .
But unfortunately , one cannot talk about politics without menti@@ oning money .
I am sad that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less financial resources than the other candi@@ dat@@ es .
This probably was par@@ tly due to the fact that I think I had a harder time asking for financial support .
And maybe I also had the ambi@@ tion to do more with less .
Some would call that very wo@@ man@@ ly of me .
But even with one third the media , one third the financial resources , and only an entreprene@@ uri@@ al team , but an amazing team , we managed to surprise everyone on elec@@ tion night , when the first numbers came in .
I surprised myself , as you may see in that photo .
( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I came in nec@@ k to nec@@ k to the leading candi@@ date .
( Che@@ ers ) Well , too early , because I didn &apos;t quite pull that , but I came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with nearly a third of the vote , and we beat the po@@ lls by an un@@ preced@@ ented mar@@ gin , or 10 perc@@ ent@@ age points above what the last po@@ ll came in at .
Some people call me the real win@@ ner of the elec@@ tion because of this , and there are many people who encour@@ aged me to run again .
But what really makes me proud is to know that I ear@@ ned propor@@ tion@@ ately higher perc@@ ent@@ age support from the young people , and a lot of people encour@@ aged my daughter to run in 20@@ 40 .
( Applause ) She is 13 , and she had never been on TV before .
And on elec@@ tion day , I obser@@ ved her on TV repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , and she was smart , she was self-@@ confid@@ ent , she was s@@ inc@@ ere , and she was sup@@ por@@ tive of her mother .
This was probably the high@@ light of my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
These are pres@@ chool girls out on a walk , and they found a pos@@ ter of me on a bus stop , and they saw the need to k@@ is@@ s it .
Audience : A@@ w !
This picture was really enough of a win for me .
What we see , we can be .
So scre@@ w fear and challenges .
( Applause ) It matters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for office , be it the office of the CE@@ O or the office of the president .
I also managed to put an impres@@ sion on your very own &quot; &quot; New Yor@@ ker . &quot; &quot; I ear@@ ned a new ti@@ tle , &quot; &quot; A living emo@@ j@@ i of sin@@ cer@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( Che@@ ers ) It is possibly my pr@@ ou@@ dest ti@@ tle yet , and the reason is that women too often get pen@@ alized for using what I call their emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that .
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
We celebr@@ ated as if we had won on elec@@ tion night , because that &apos;s how we felt .
So you don &apos;t necessarily have to reach that office .
You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow beyond anything you will experience before .
So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this journey , probably more les@@ sons than I can share here in the time we have today .
But rest assu@@ red , it was hard work .
I lost a lot of sleep during those months .
It took resili@@ ence and per@@ sever@@ ance to not qu@@ it , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are truly , auth@@ en@@ tically listening to your own voice and working in ali@@ gn@@ ment with that .
As a good sister of mine sometimes says , you may che@@ at on your intui@@ tion , but your intui@@ tion never che@@ ats on you .
I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any journey you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along .
It &apos;s having people around you who share your values , your vision , but are different in every other way .
That &apos;s the for@@ mula for success for me , and I am bl@@ essed with an amazing husband , here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as entreprene@@ urs in the political arena , and pu@@ lled something off that everyone said would be impossible .
As a matter of fact , the leading PR exper@@ t told me before I made my decision that I would do well to get seven percent .
I appreci@@ ated his perspective , because he was probably right , and he was bas@@ ing it on valuable experience .
But on the one percent day , I decided here to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s very important to men@@ tion this , because I did lose a lot of sleep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me .
We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves .
And it &apos;s two things that I think are very important in that , in surro@@ un@@ ding yourself with people and practic@@ es that n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh you , but it &apos;s equ@@ ally important , maybe even more important , to have the cour@@ age to get rid of people and practic@@ es that take away your energy , including the wonderful b@@ log@@ gers and com@@ ment@@ ators .
I took a lot of support from others in doing this , and I made the decision to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s par@@ tly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this .
And when I lost my energy for a moment — and I did from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I went back to why I decided to run , and how I had decided to run my own race .
I called it a 4@@ G campaign , the G &apos;s represent@@ ing the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c words .
And the first one is called &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n . &quot; &quot; I ran to do good , to be of service , and I wanted serv@@ ant leadership to be at the center of how I worked and everybody else in the campaign .
Second one is &quot; &quot; G@@ le@@ ð@@ i , &quot; &quot; or joy .
I decided to enjoy the journey .
There was a lot to be taken out of the journey , no matter if the destin@@ ation was re@@ ached or not .
And I tried my u@@ t@@ most to inspi@@ re others to do so as well .
Th@@ ird is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n@@ s@@ æ@@ i . &quot; &quot; I was open to any questions .
I kept no secre@@ ts , and it was all open , on Facebook and web@@ sites .
Because I think if you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing your president , you deser@@ ve answers to your questions .
Last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we ran on the principle of Gir@@ l@@ power .
( Che@@ ers ) I am incredibly gl@@ ad that I had the cour@@ age to run , to risk failure but recei@@ ve success on so many levels .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my entire team will agree with me , that it was worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ at M@@ itch@@ ell : I &apos;m not le@@ tting you go yet . H@@ alla T@@ ó@@ mas@@ dó@@ t@@ tir : What a great crow@@ d . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to I@@ cel@@ and and vote for you .
But of course we probably can &apos;t vote there , but one thing we can get from I@@ cel@@ and and have always gotten is inspir@@ ation .
I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 197@@ 5 when all the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c women walked out , and that really was a very big factor in laun@@ ching the women &apos;s movement .
You made a refer@@ ence to it earlier . I &apos;d love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a stand@@ still .
And then what you may not know because our American media did not report it , the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c women walked out again on Mon@@ day . Right ?
H@@ T : Yes , they did . PM : Can you tell us about that ?
H@@ T : Yes , so 4@@ 1 years after the original stri@@ ke , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done .
So at 2 : 3@@ 8@@ p@@ m on Mon@@ day , women in I@@ cel@@ and left work , because that &apos;s when they had ear@@ ned their day &apos;s sal@@ ary .
( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about this is that young women and men particip@@ ated in greater numbers than before , because it is time that we close the pay gap .
PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask H@@ alla to comm@@ it right now to what she &apos;s doing next , but I will say that you &apos;d have a very large volunte@@ er ar@@ my should you decide to do that again .
Thank you H@@ alla .
H@@ T : Thank you all .
( Applause )
And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the vill@@ agers who live in the most remote areas of Africa .
This is a very serious problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ arily not addres@@ sed .
So they issu@@ ed an e@@ dic@@ t , in effect , that prev@@ ents women from being pri@@ ests , past@@ ors , dea@@ con@@ s in the ch@@ urch , or cha@@ pla@@ ins in the military , and if a woman teach@@ es a class@@ room in a Sou@@ thern B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st sem@@ in@@ ary , they cannot teach if a boy is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the Bi@@ ble , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the Bi@@ ble , that say that a woman shouldn &apos;t teach a man , and so forth .
The other very serious bli@@ ght that causes this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive res@@ or@@ t to violence , and that is increasing tremend@@ ously around the world .
When I was in office as govern@@ or of Geor@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ fold increase .
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death pen@@ al@@ ty that is a developed country .
Let me just go down a very few ab@@ uses of women that concer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fairly bri@@ ef , because I have a limited amount of time , as you know .
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ til@@ ation .
Gen@@ ital mu@@ til@@ ation is horrible and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very soon in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely cut away by a so@@ -@@ called cu@@ tter who has a raz@@ or bl@@ ade and , in a non-@@ st@@ eri@@ liz@@ ed way , they re@@ move the exterior parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ alia .
And sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they se@@ w the ori@@ fic@@ e up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ stru@@ ate .
This is not a rare thing , although it &apos;s against the law in most countries .
In Egyp@@ t , for instance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fem@@ ales that live in Egyp@@ t today have been sex@@ ually mu@@ til@@ ated in that way .
In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach mat@@ urity .
This is a horrible aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
Another problem that we have in the world that rel@@ ates to women particularly is s@@ la@@ very , or human traf@@ fic@@ king it &apos;s called now@@ ad@@ ays .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human bon@@ da@@ ge , or s@@ la@@ very .
Atl@@ anta , Geor@@ gi@@ a , where the Car@@ ter Center is loc@@ ated and where I teach at E@@ mor@@ y University , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into s@@ la@@ very every month .
It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
The sex trade in Atl@@ anta , Geor@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ eds the total drug trade in Atl@@ anta , Geor@@ gi@@ a .
And this leads to one of the worst problems , and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual s@@ la@@ very in all countries in the world .
Sw@@ eden has got a good approach to it .
Ab@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , Sw@@ eden decided to change the law , and women are no longer pro@@ secu@@ ted if they are in sexual s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ th@@ el ow@@ ners and the p@@ im@@ ps and the male cust@@ omers are pro@@ secu@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pro@@ stitu@@ tion has gone down .
In the United States , we take just the opposite position .
For every male arr@@ ested for il@@ legal sex trade , 25 women are arr@@ ested in the United States of America .
Canada , I@@ rel@@ and , I &apos;ve already said Sw@@ eden , Fr@@ ance , and other countries are moving now towards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ we@@ dis@@ h model .
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admi@@ re : our military and our great university system .
That law needs to be changed .
They &apos;re not pro@@ secu@@ ted .
Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
When I became president , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent .
So we &apos;ve made some progress , parti@@ ally because I was president and so forth — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years .
These are the kind of things that go on .
Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country .
Another problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like nation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War .
Sometimes , we &apos;ve had soldi@@ ers on the ground fighting .
The other times , we &apos;ve been flying over@@ head dro@@ pping bomb@@ s on people .
There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t drop a bo@@ mb , we didn &apos;t la@@ unch a mis@@ si@@ le , we didn &apos;t fire a bu@@ lle@@ t .
But anyway , those kinds of things , the res@@ or@@ t to violence and the mis@@ interpret@@ ation of the ho@@ ly scrip@@ tures are what causes , are the basic causes , of ab@@ use of women and girls .
There &apos;s one more basic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in general , men don &apos;t give a dam@@ n .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qui@@ et@@ ly accep@@ ts the privi@@ leg@@ ed position that we occu@@ py , and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child , when separate but equal had exist@@ ed .
Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ crimin@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they enjoy a privi@@ leg@@ ed position .
So what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one , and where you come from , Europe and so forth , who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act , need to take the responsibility on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in dem@@ anding an end to raci@@ al dis@@ crimin@@ ation against girls and women all over the world .
I didn &apos;t even go down to detail about that .
But I hope that out of this conference , that every woman here will get your hus@@ ban@@ ds to realize that these ab@@ uses on the college camp@@ uses and the military and so forth and in the future job market , need to protect your dau@@ gh@@ ters and your grand@@ dau@@ gh@@ ters .

When I was a student here in Oxford in the 197@@ 0s , the future of the world was ble@@ ak .
The population explo@@ sion was un@@ stop@@ p@@ able .
Global fam@@ ine was inevitable .
A cancer epidem@@ ic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shor@@ ten our lives .
The aci@@ d rain was fall@@ ing on the for@@ ests .
The desert was adv@@ ancing by a mile or two a year .
The oil was running out , and a nuclear win@@ ter would finish us off .
N@@ one of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per@@ -@@ cap@@ ita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ed for inf@@ l@@ ation , has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
Li@@ f@@ esp@@ an is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Chi@@ ld mortality is down by two-@@ thir@@ ds .
Per@@ -@@ cap@@ ita food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has dou@@ bled .
How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only species that becomes more prosper@@ ous as it becomes more popul@@ ous ?
The size of the blo@@ b in this graph repres@@ ents the size of the population , and the level of the graph repres@@ ents GDP per cap@@ ita .
I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and en@@ able their ideas to comb@@ ine and re@@ comb@@ ine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
These are both real objects .
One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ le@@ an hand ax@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by Ho@@ mo er@@ ec@@ tus .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an un@@ can@@ ny degree .
I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their simi@@ lar@@ ity is not that interesting .
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying design for about a million years — from one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago .
Ho@@ mo er@@ ec@@ tus made the same tool for 3@@ 0,000 generations .
Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed s@@ lower than skelet@@ ons in those days .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Wh@@ er@@ eas the object on the right is ob@@ sole@@ te after five years .
And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one subst@@ ance .
The object on the right is made from a conf@@ ection of different subst@@ ances , from si@@ licon and metal and plastic and so on .
And more than that , it &apos;s a conf@@ ection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a las@@ er , the idea of tran@@ sist@@ ors .
They &apos;ve all been comb@@ ined together in this technology .
And it &apos;s this combination , this cu@@ mul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tri@@ gues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body &apos;s an accu@@ mul@@ ation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells .
They &apos;ve come together .
How does evolution do cu@@ mul@@ ative , combin@@ atori@@ al things ?
Well , it uses sexual re@@ production .
In an as@@ ex@@ ual species , if you get two different mut@@ ations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
One goes ext@@ inct for the other to survive .
But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inher@@ it both mut@@ ations from different lin@@ e@@ ages .
So what sex does is it en@@ ables the individual to draw upon the genetic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the hab@@ it of ex@@ changing one thing for another .
It &apos;s a unique human fe@@ ature .
No other animal does it .
You can teach them in the labor@@ atory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and indeed there &apos;s reci@@ pro@@ city in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one object for another never happens .
As A@@ dam S@@ mit@@ h said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair ex@@ change of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change .
You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture .
Ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ees , kil@@ ler wh@@ ales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
They teach each other tradi@@ tions which are hand@@ ed down from par@@ ent to off@@ spring .
In this case , chimp@@ anz@@ ees teaching each other how to cr@@ ack nu@@ ts with ro@@ cks .
But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never exp@@ and , never grow , never accu@@ mul@@ ate , never become combin@@ atori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas .
Ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ee tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change raise living stand@@ ards ?
Well , the answer came from David Ric@@ ardo in 18@@ 17 .
And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
A@@ dam takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z takes one hour to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than A@@ dam .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ dam .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ dam make two ax@@ es , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ dam is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars .
So the g@@ ains from trade are only going to grow .
And this is one of the be@@ au@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually creates the mo@@ ment@@ um for more speci@@ alization , which creates the mo@@ ment@@ um for more ex@@ change and so on .
A@@ dam and O@@ z both saved an hour of time .
That is prosper@@ ity , the saving of time in satis@@ fying your needs .
As@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this ev@@ ening to read a book by .
If you had to start from scr@@ atch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
You find a she@@ ep . You kill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
You ren@@ der it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , etc. etc .
How long is it going to take you ? Qui@@ te a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average w@@ age in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average w@@ age to ac@@ qui@@ re that much light .
And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosper@@ ity that you &apos;ve g@@ ain@@ ed since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qui@@ re another good or service .
And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the average w@@ age .
B@@ ack in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a c@@ and@@ le that could bur@@ n for an hour .
In other words , the average person on the average w@@ age could not afford a c@@ and@@ le in 18@@ 00 .
Go back to this image of the ax@@ e and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone ax@@ e was made by someone for himself .
It was self-@@ suf@@ fici@@ ency .
We call that poverty these days .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Ten@@ s ? H@@ und@@ re@@ ds ? Th@@ ou@@ sands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who grew the coffee , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was dri@@ lling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achiev@@ ed as a species .
In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employ@@ ed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ les , or whatever .
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to prepar@@ e his dinner every night .
But a modern tou@@ ri@@ st going around the pal@@ ace of Ver@@ sa@@ il@@ les and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pictures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his dinner toni@@ ght too .
They &apos;re in bi@@ str@@ os and caf@@ es and restaur@@ ants and sho@@ ps all over Par@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excel@@ l@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got higher quality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
We &apos;re able to draw upon speci@@ alization and ex@@ change to raise each other &apos;s living stand@@ ards .
Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
An@@ ts are a clas@@ sic example ; workers work for que@@ ens and que@@ ens work for workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ ony .
There &apos;s no working for each other across the coloni@@ es .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ productive divi@@ sion of labor .
That is to say , they speci@@ alize with respect to re@@ production .
The que@@ en does it all .
In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
It &apos;s the one thing we insi@@ st on doing for ourselves , is re@@ production .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave re@@ production to the Qu@@ een .
( Applause ) So when did this hab@@ it start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ dest version of this is probably the sexual divi@@ sion of labor .
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
In all hun@@ ter@@ -@@ gather@@ er societies today , there &apos;s a for@@ aging divi@@ sion of labor between , on the whole , hun@@ ting males and gather@@ ing fem@@ ales .
It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dist@@ inc@@ tion between speci@@ alized ro@@ les for males and fem@@ ales .
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
The woman knows that , in the H@@ ad@@ zas &apos; case here — dig@@ ging ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to di@@ g some extra ro@@ ots and trade them for meat .
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ ust@@ ing hun@@ t and try and kill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any dig@@ ging to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kil@@ ls a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both sides raise each other &apos;s stand@@ ards of living through the sexual divi@@ sion of labor .
When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this .
They were a highly cooper@@ ative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than y@@ ours and mine in this room today .
They were imagin@@ ative . They bur@@ i@@ ed their dead .
They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ istic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual divi@@ sion of labor .
There &apos;s no evidence of gather@@ ing behavior by fem@@ ales .
It looks like the fem@@ ales were cooper@@ ative hun@@ ters with the men .
And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is ex@@ change between groups , because the objects that you find in Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al rema@@ ins , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
For example , in the C@@ au@@ cas@@ us there &apos;s a site where you find local Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al tools .
They &apos;re always made from local ch@@ ert .
In the same val@@ ley there are modern human rema@@ ins from about the same date , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from local ch@@ ert , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away .
And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were ex@@ changing between groups .
Tra@@ de is 10 times as old as farm@@ ing .
People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
Ex@@ change between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
And the earli@@ est evidence for it cro@@ ps up somewhere between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long dist@@ ances in E@@ thi@@ opi@@ a .
You also see se@@ as@@ hel@@ ls — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 1@@ 25 miles in@@ land from the Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean in Al@@ g@@ eria .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started ex@@ changing between groups .
And that will have led to speci@@ alization .
How do you know that long-@@ distance movement means trade rather than migr@@ ation ?
Well , you look at modern hun@@ ter gather@@ ers like ab@@ origin@@ als , who qu@@ arri@@ ed for stone ax@@ es at a place called Moun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ arry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ ado@@ on tri@@ be .
They trad@@ ed them with their neighb@@ ors for things like st@@ ingr@@ ay bar@@ bs , and the consequ@@ ence was that stone ax@@ es ended up over a large part of Australia .
So long-@@ distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migr@@ ation .
What happens when you cut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ alize ?
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into re@@ verse .
An example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
When the sea level ro@@ se and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced s@@ lower progress than people on the main@@ land , they actually experienced re@@ gress .
They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fish@@ ing equipment and clo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to main@@ tain the speci@@ alized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a desert island .
How many of the things in our po@@ ck@@ ets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fu@@ ego — similar island , similar people .
The reason : because Tierra del Fu@@ ego is separ@@ ated from South America by a much n@@ arro@@ wer straight , and there was tr@@ ading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
The T@@ as@@ mani@@ ans were isol@@ ated .
Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
In the case of the stone ax@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
No@@ body , literally nobody .
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
The person on the assem@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dri@@ ll an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
I am of course quot@@ ing from a famous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the economi@@ st in the 195@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ enci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a p@@ enci@@ l came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a p@@ enci@@ l , because the people who assem@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to mine grap@@ hi@@ te , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ alization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
With language we have to trans@@ fer ideas that we understand with each other .
But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our cap@@ abilities .
We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some groups have higher I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other groups .
It &apos;s completely ir@@ relevant .
What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individuals are .
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the meeting and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is ca@@ using technological progress , increment@@ ally , bit by bit .
However , bad things happen .
And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
There will be war@@ s ; there will be depres@@ sions ; there will be natural dis@@ ast@@ ers .
A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and therefore living stand@@ ards will adv@@ ance .
Because through the cloud , through crow@@ d sour@@ c@@ ing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the eli@@ tes but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are su@@ rely acceler@@ ating the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

Good after@@ no@@ on .
My name is U@@ l@@ du@@ s .
I am a phot@@ o-@@ based artist from Rus@@ sia .
I focus on bal@@ ancing mean@@ ing@@ ful message , a@@ es@@ thetic , beauty , com@@ position , some ir@@ ony , and arti@@ facts .
Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , which is named D@@ esper@@ ate Ro@@ man@@ tics .
They &apos;re my arti@@ facts , or pa@@ int@@ ings from pre-@@ R@@ ap@@ ha@@ eli@@ tes Bro@@ ther@@ hood England mid@@ -@@ 19@@ th century .
I took the painting and gi@@ f@@ ted new , contempor@@ ary meaning talking about issues which are surro@@ un@@ ding me in Rus@@ sia , captur@@ ing people who are non-@@ models but have an interesting story .
This boy is a professional dan@@ cer , only 12 years old , but at secon@@ dar@@ y school , he hi@@ des his d@@ ancing clas@@ ses and is wearing the mas@@ k of bru@@ tality , trying to be un@@ ited with the rest of his class@@ mates like a stor@@ m tro@@ op@@ er has no person@@ ality .
But this boy has go@@ als and dreams but hi@@ des it to be soci@@ ally accep@@ ted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Rus@@ sia .
N@@ ext por@@ tra@@ it interpret@@ ation is metap@@ hori@@ c .
And this is Ni@@ k@@ ita , a security gu@@ ard from one of the bar@@ s in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
He li@@ kes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m an@@ gry , &quot; &quot; quot@@ ing H@@ ul@@ k from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him an@@ gry .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new t@@ emp@@ tation about it .
Sometimes , I would compare facial fe@@ atures and playing with words : ir@@ ony , Ir@@ on Man , ir@@ oning man .
( Laughter ) Th@@ r@@ ough the arti@@ facts , I bring social issues which surro@@ und me in Rus@@ sia into the conversation .
Inter@@ esting fact about marriage in Rus@@ sia , that most of the 18 , 19@@ -year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
We &apos;re taught from childhood , successful marriage means successful life , so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
For Rus@@ sian society , I &apos;m an old ma@@ id and ho@@ pel@@ ess to ever get married .
That &apos;s why you see me in a Mex@@ ican fi@@ ghter mas@@ k , in the w@@ ed@@ ding dres@@ s , all desper@@ ate in my gar@@ den .
But remember , ir@@ ony is the key , and this is actually to motiv@@ ate girls to fight for go@@ als , for dreams , and change ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pes .
B@@ e br@@ ave . B@@ e ir@@ onic — it helps .
B@@ e funny and create some magic .

My name is Am@@ it .
And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ eu@@ ms and art to my bos@@ s who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun , negoti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting mus@@ eu@@ ms from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
And I grew up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these mus@@ eu@@ ms and these art@@ works .
And so when I started travel@@ ing and going to these mus@@ eu@@ ms , I started learning a lot .
And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more acc@@ es@@ sible with technology together .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ unch .
So , simple : you come to Goog@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ .@@ com@@ .
You look around at all these mus@@ eu@@ ms here .
You &apos;ve got the U@@ f@@ fi@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ M@@ A , the Her@@ mit@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the Van Go@@ gh .
I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my fav@@ orit@@ es , the Me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan Mus@@ eum of Ar@@ t in New York .
Two ways of going in — very simple .
C@@ lic@@ k and , ban@@ g , you &apos;re in this museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ om@@ b@@ ay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
You move around , you have fun .
You want to navi@@ gate around the museum ?
O@@ p@@ en the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corri@@ dor .
Ke@@ ep going . Have fun .
Ex@@ pl@@ ore .
( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pa@@ int@@ ings , &quot; &quot; The Harv@@ est@@ ers &quot; &quot; by Pi@@ e@@ ter B@@ ru@@ eg@@ el at the M@@ et .
I see this plus sign .
If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ ga@@ pi@@ x@@ el technology .
So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can zo@@ om around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his expres@@ sion is pr@@ ic@@ eless .
But then you really want to go deep .
And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a stick on Sh@@ ro@@ ve Tu@@ es@@ day .
And appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cr@@ acks .
Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the Mo@@ M@@ A , again in New York .
So another one of my fav@@ orit@@ es , &quot; &quot; The Star@@ ry N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
But what if you want to see br@@ ush str@@ o@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how Van Go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
You zo@@ om in . You really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ acks .
This is &quot; &quot; The Star@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature .
There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Co@@ ll@@ ec@@ tions .
An@@ y one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a f@@ ancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Po@@ wer of Z@@ o@@ om — you can just zo@@ om around .
This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ mb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the National G@@ all@@ ery .
You can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
So I think , in conclu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t , in my opini@@ on , even come from the mus@@ eu@@ ms .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these artists .
And that &apos;s been my hu@@ m@@ bling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
And the biggest question I get asked now@@ ad@@ ays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replic@@ ate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to sup@@ pl@@ ement the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing no@@ vel@@ s — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of stor@@ y@@ telling and also some super@@ natural creatures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ ni .
But before I go there , please allow me to share with you gli@@ mp@@ ses of my personal story .
I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geo@@ metr@@ ical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several cir@@ cles .
I was born in S@@ tras@@ b@@ our@@ g , Fr@@ ance to Tur@@ k@@ ish parents .
S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got separ@@ ated , and I came to Tur@@ key with my mom .
From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
Now in the early 197@@ 0s , in An@@ k@@ ara , that was a bit un@@ usual .
Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fa@@ thers were the heads of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , so I grew up seeing my mother as a di@@ vor@@ ce@@ e in a pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l environment .
In fact , I grew up obser@@ ving two different kinds of wo@@ man@@ hood .
On the one hand was my mother , a well-@@ educ@@ ated , sec@@ ular , modern , w@@ ester@@ ni@@ zed , Tur@@ k@@ ish woman .
On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spir@@ itual , less educ@@ ated and definitely less rational .
This was a woman who read coffee gro@@ unds to see the future and mel@@ ted lead into myst@@ eri@@ ous shapes to f@@ end off the evi@@ l eye .
Many people visi@@ ted my grandmother , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ ne on their faces or war@@ ts on their hands .
Each time , my grandmother would u@@ tter some words in Ar@@ abi@@ c , take a red ap@@ ple and st@@ a@@ b it with as many ro@@ se th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move .
Then one by one , she would enci@@ r@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with dark ink .
A week later , the patient would come back for a fol@@ low-@@ up examin@@ ation .
Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visi@@ ted my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed .
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of pr@@ aying ?
In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pr@@ aying is effective , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ cles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , am@@ ong@@ st many other things , one very preci@@ ous lesson — that if you want to des@@ tr@@ oy something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a bl@@ em@@ ish or the human sou@@ l , all you need to do is to surro@@ und it with th@@ ick walls .
It will dry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
We all do .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
But if we have no connection what@@ so@@ ever with the worl@@ ds beyond the one we take for gr@@ ant@@ ed , then we too run the risk of dr@@ ying up inside .
Our imagination might sh@@ r@@ ink ; our hear@@ ts might dw@@ ind@@ le , and our human@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we stay for too long inside our cultural co@@ co@@ ons .
Our friends , neighb@@ ors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle res@@ em@@ ble us , it means we are surro@@ unded with our mir@@ ror image .
Now one other thing women like my grand@@ ma do in Tur@@ key is to cover mir@@ r@@ ors with vel@@ v@@ et or to han@@ g them on the walls with their bac@@ ks facing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ aster@@ n tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own refl@@ ection .
Ir@@ on@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the li@@ ke@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the greatest d@@ angers of today &apos;s glob@@ alized world .
And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liber@@ als and conserv@@ atives , ag@@ nos@@ tics and beli@@ e@@ vers , the rich and the poor , East and West ali@@ ke .
We tend to form clu@@ sters based on simi@@ lar@@ ity , and then we produce ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pes about other clu@@ sters of people .
In my opini@@ on , one way of trans@@ cen@@ ding these cultural gh@@ et@@ tos is through the art of stor@@ y@@ telling .
St@@ ories cannot demo@@ li@@ sh fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can pun@@ ch holes in our mental walls .
And through those holes , we can get a gli@@ mp@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
I started writing fic@@ tion at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journ@@ al .
In retro@@ sp@@ ect , I think she was slightly worried about my san@@ ity .
I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imagin@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good .
I was an intro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with colo@@ red cra@@ y@@ ons and apo@@ logi@@ zing to objects when I bu@@ mp@@ ed into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day experiences and emotions .
What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
And th@@ us began my life@@ -@@ long passion for writing fic@@ tion .
So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an auto@@ bi@@ ograph@@ ical manif@@ est@@ ation than a trans@@ c@@ end@@ ental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ plom@@ at .
So from this small , super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous , mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zo@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , international school &#91; in Mad@@ rid &#93; , where I was the only Tur@@ k .
It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; represent@@ ative fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our class@@ room , there were children from all n@@ ation@@ alities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cos@@ mo@@ poli@@ tan , eg@@ al@@ it@@ arian class@@ room democracy .
Instead , it gener@@ ated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the represent@@ ative of something larger .
We were like a mini@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was fun , except wh@@ enever something negative , with regar@@ ds to a nation or a religion , took place .
The child who represent@@ ed it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ed and bu@@ lli@@ ed end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly .
And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a military ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a gun@@ man of my n@@ ation@@ ality nearly killed the P@@ op@@ e , and Tur@@ key got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test .
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ pped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of becoming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
I also had my first tas@@ te of cultural ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pes there .
The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night Ex@@ press , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qui@@ red how many ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes a day I smo@@ ked , because they thought all Tur@@ ks were heavy smo@@ kers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ vering my hair .
I came to learn that these were the three main ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pes about my country : politics , ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes and the ve@@ il .
After S@@ pain , we went to J@@ or@@ dan , Germany and An@@ k@@ ara again .
Every@@ where I went , I felt like my imagination was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me .
St@@ ories gave me a sense of center , continu@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I otherwise l@@ acked .
In my mid@@ -@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I moved to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore .
I lived in a very vibr@@ ant , diver@@ se neighborhood where I wrote several of my no@@ vel@@ s .
I was in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake hit in 199@@ 9 .
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my trac@@ ks .
There was the local gro@@ cer there — a gru@@ mp@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t sell al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t speak to mar@@ gin@@ als .
He was sitting next to a trans@@ vesti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ cara running down her che@@ e@@ ks .
I watched the man open a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes with tre@@ m@@ bling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a conserv@@ ative gro@@ cer and a cr@@ ying trans@@ vesti@@ te smo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ walk .
In the face of death and destruc@@ tion , our mun@@ dan@@ e differences ev@@ a@@ por@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the magn@@ itu@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are reading a good no@@ vel , we leave our small , co@@ z@@ y apart@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ ased against .
S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Mic@@ hi@@ gan .
I experienced this , not so much as a ge@@ ograph@@ ical shift , as a lin@@ gu@@ istic one .
I started writing fic@@ tion in English .
I &apos;m not an im@@ migr@@ ant , refuge@@ e or exi@@ le — they ask me why I do this — but the com@@ mu@@ te between languages gives me the chance to re@@ create myself .
I love writing in Tur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very poe@@ tic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an ac@@ qui@@ red language .
When you &apos;re a lat@@ e@@ comer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continu@@ ous and perpe@@ tual frustr@@ ation .
As lat@@ e@@ com@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cr@@ ack better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the ton@@ gue .
And that gap is very inti@@ mi@@ dat@@ ing .
But if we manage not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also stimul@@ ating .
And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustr@@ ation was very stimul@@ ating .
At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing an@@ xi@@ ety , started to inclu@@ de in her daily pr@@ ay@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get married so that I could se@@ ttle down once and for all .
And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get married .
( Laughter ) But instead of sett@@ ling down , I went to Ari@@ zona .
And since my husband is in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , I started com@@ mu@@ ting between Ari@@ zona and I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
I guess one part of me has always been a no@@ ma@@ d , physic@@ ally and spir@@ it@@ ually .
St@@ ories ac@@ company me , keeping my pieces and mem@@ ories together , like an exist@@ ential glu@@ e .
Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also be@@ gun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
When my first no@@ vel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mark from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic .
&quot; I li@@ ked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ pan@@ ish , American , H@@ is@@ p@@ anic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Tur@@ k@@ ish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the no@@ vel took place on a university cam@@ pus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Tur@@ k@@ ish characters , but I understood what my cri@@ tic was looking for .
And I also understood that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the manif@@ est@@ ation of my identity .
He was looking for a Tur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics aff@@ ects the way stories are being circul@@ ated , read and re@@ vie@@ wed .
Many auth@@ ors feel this pressure , but non-@@ Western auth@@ ors feel it more he@@ avi@@ ly .
If you &apos;re a woman writ@@ er from the Musli@@ m world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Musli@@ m women and , prefer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy Musli@@ m women .
You &apos;re expected to write informa@@ tive , po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant and character@@ istic stories and leave the experim@@ ental and av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de to your Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child in that school in Mad@@ rid is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
W@@ rit@@ ers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the represent@@ atives of their resp@@ ective cul@@ tures : a few auth@@ ors from China , a few from Tur@@ key , a few from Nigeria .
We &apos;re all thought to have something very dist@@ inc@@ tive , if not p@@ ecu@@ liar .
The writ@@ er and com@@ mu@@ ter James Bal@@ d@@ win gave an inter@@ view in 198@@ 4 in which he was repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly asked about his homo@@ sex@@ u@@ ality .
When the inter@@ vie@@ wer tried to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hole him as a gay writ@@ er , Bal@@ d@@ win stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put lab@@ els on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in dan@@ ger .
There &apos;s a fu@@ zz@@ y categ@@ ory called multi@@ cultural liter@@ ature in which all auth@@ ors from outside the Western world are lu@@ mp@@ ed together .
I never forget my first multi@@ cultural reading , in Harvard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago .
We were three writ@@ ers , one from the Phi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines , one Tur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ don@@ esi@@ an — like a jo@@ ke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an arti@@ stic st@@ yle or a liter@@ ary tas@@ te .
It was only because of our pass@@ ports .
M@@ ulti@@ cultural writ@@ ers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imagin@@ ary .
A function is at@@ tribu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
In this way , not only the writ@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional characters become the represent@@ atives of something larger .
But I must quickly add that this tend@@ ency to see a story as more than a story does not sol@@ ely come from the West .
It comes from everywhere .
And I experienced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fic@@ tional characters u@@ t@@ tered in a no@@ vel .
I had inten@@ ded to write a construc@@ tive , multi@@ -@@ lay@@ ered no@@ vel about an Ar@@ men@@ i@@ an and a Tur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women .
My mic@@ ro story became a mac@@ ro issue when I was pro@@ secu@@ ted .
Some people cri@@ tici@@ zed , others pr@@ ais@@ ed me for writing about the Tur@@ k@@ ish@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ i@@ an conflict .
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both sides that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to be@@ little my work .
I want to love and celebr@@ ate fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end .
W@@ rit@@ ers are enti@@ t@@ led to their political opini@@ ons , and there are good political no@@ vel@@ s out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of daily politics .
Che@@ k@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correc@@ t way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely separate things .
And only the lat@@ ter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty politics divi@@ des us . F@@ ic@@ tion conn@@ ects .
One is interested in swe@@ eping gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
The other , in nu@@ ances .
One dra@@ ws bo@@ und@@ aries .
The other recogni@@ zes no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty politics is made of soli@@ d br@@ icks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
In the O@@ t@@ toman times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ d@@ da@@ h . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often impro@@ vis@@ ing .
With each new person in the story , the me@@ d@@ da@@ h would change his voice , im@@ person@@ ating that character .
Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sul@@ tan , Musli@@ ms and non-@@ Musli@@ ms .
St@@ ories cut across all bo@@ und@@ aries , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ ales of N@@ as@@ red@@ di@@ n Ho@@ d@@ ja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Bal@@ k@@ ans and Asia .
Today , stories continue to trans@@ c@@ end bor@@ ders .
When Pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an and Isra@@ el@@ i politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an read@@ er still re@@ ads a no@@ vel by a Je@@ wish auth@@ or , and v@@ ice ver@@ sa , conn@@ ecting and em@@ path@@ iz@@ ing with the narr@@ ator .
L@@ iter@@ ature has to take us beyond .
If it cannot take us there , it is not good liter@@ ature .
Bo@@ o@@ ks have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that I was — that I once was .
But I &apos;m also aware of the dan@@ ger of fe@@ ti@@ shi@@ zing them .
When the po@@ et and my@@ stic , Ru@@ mi , met his spir@@ itual compani@@ on , Sha@@ ms of T@@ abri@@ z , one of the first things the lat@@ ter did was to to@@ ss Ru@@ mi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dis@@ solve .
The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ now@@ le@@ dge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural gh@@ et@@ tos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us eli@@ ti@@ st , dist@@ ant and dis@@ connected .
There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing com@@ pass .
As you know , one leg of the com@@ pass is st@@ atic , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place .
Me@@ an@@ while , the other leg dra@@ ws a wide circle , constantly moving .
Like that , my fic@@ tion as well .
One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , with strong Tur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part trav@@ els the world , conn@@ ecting to different cul@@ tures .
In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
Now those of you who have been to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ ap@@ i Pal@@ ace , which was the resid@@ ence of O@@ t@@ toman sul@@ t@@ ans for more than 400 years .
In the pal@@ ace , just outside the quar@@ ters of the favorite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n .
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this concept .
We usually distr@@ ust those areas that fall in between things .
We see them as the do@@ main of super@@ natural creatures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of smo@@ k@@ eless fire and are the sym@@ bol of el@@ usi@@ ven@@ ess .
But my point is perhaps that el@@ u@@ sive space is what writ@@ ers and artists need most .
When I write fic@@ tion I ch@@ er@@ ish el@@ usi@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I might write about a Musli@@ m woman in one no@@ vel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a hand@@ some , gay prof@@ essor in Nor@@ way .
As long as it comes from our hear@@ ts , we can write about anything and everything .
A@@ ud@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fa@@ thers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She sugg@@ ested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradig@@ m shift .
And yet , why is it that , in creative writing cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
Per@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
Imagin@@ ative liter@@ ature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
We should teach young people and ourselves to exp@@ and our hear@@ ts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cultural gh@@ et@@ to and go visit the next one and the next .
In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ sh@@ es , drawing cir@@ cles beyond cir@@ cles .
They connect all humanity , regar@@ d@@ less of identity politics , and that is the good news .
And I would like to finish with an old Su@@ f@@ i po@@ em : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ vers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ ane Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game designer .
We do achieve more in game worl@@ ds .
So , so far , coll@@ ectively all the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the virtual problems of A@@ zer@@ oth .
Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build stron@@ ger social relationships as a result .
Fi@@ ve million people use it every month .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
His work is brilliant .
But it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
Be@@ fore we had awesome game contro@@ ll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
This is really exciting .
Ac@@ cording to H@@ ero@@ d@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
We want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
We made this game in 2007 .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hic no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got level@@ ing up in skills like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little town in Col@@ or@@ ado , called C@@ ra@@ i@@ g .
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ zen square miles . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es .
And the job in question was she@@ ep ran@@ ch@@ er .
My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
I &apos;m an ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
And my respon@@ sibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
The job in question : her@@ ding she@@ ep . Great .
We go to C@@ ra@@ i@@ g and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that cas@@ tr@@ ation is going to be an absolu@@ te part of this work .
So , normally , I never do any research at all .
But , this is a tou@@ ch@@ y subject , and I work for the Dis@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ nel , and we want to por@@ tr@@ ay accur@@ ately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
So I called the Hu@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be cas@@ trat@@ ing some lam@@ bs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty strai@@ ght@@ forward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber band , like this , only a little smaller .
This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain famili@@ ar@@ ity to it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , ti@@ ghtly .
And then another band is applied to the scr@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ ghtly .
B@@ loo@@ d flow is slowly re@@ tar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
&quot; Great — got it . &quot;
OK , I call the S@@ P@@ CA to confir@@ m this — they confir@@ m it .
I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confir@@ m it .
OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
So the next day I go out .
And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the lam@@ bs and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
M@@ el@@ ani@@ e is the wife of Al@@ bert .
Al@@ bert is the sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d in question .
M@@ el@@ ani@@ e pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , li@@ ke@@ wise on the left .
L@@ am@@ b goes on the pos@@ t , she open@@ s it up .
Al@@ right . Great .
Al@@ bert goes in , I follow Al@@ bert , the cre@@ w is around .
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
Be@@ ing an ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that .
Al@@ bert re@@ aches in his po@@ cket to pull out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber band but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe .
And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know .
And he kind of f@@ lic@@ ked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , it was very — it was , it was impres@@ sive .
In the space of about two seconds , Al@@ bert had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ til@@ age of the tail , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the lam@@ b , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bu@@ cket that I was holding .
A second later , with a big th@@ u@@ mb and a well call@@ ous@@ ed fore@@ finger , he had the scr@@ ot@@ um fir@@ m@@ ly in his gras@@ p .
And he pu@@ lled it toward him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p .
Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
He s@@ ni@@ ps it , thro@@ ws the ti@@ p over his shoul@@ der , and then grab@@ s the scr@@ ot@@ um and push@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , obs@@ cur@@ ing my view , but what I hear is a sl@@ ur@@ ping sound , and a noise that sounds like V@@ el@@ cr@@ o being y@@ an@@ ked off a stic@@ ky wall and I am not even kid@@ ding .
Can we roll the video ?
No I &apos;m kid@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; sho@@ ot , ever .
I say , &quot; &quot; Ti@@ me out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scrip@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense .
We don &apos;t fo@@ ol around , we don &apos;t re@@ hear@@ se — we sho@@ ot what we get !
I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is nu@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ bert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are t@@ es@@ tic@@ les in this bu@@ cket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Hu@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Hu@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lam@@ b s@@ que@@ al and ble@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de .
We &apos;re on twice a day on the Dis@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ nel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pu@@ lls out a ba@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds .
M@@ el@@ ani@@ e pic@@ ks up another lam@@ b , puts it on the pos@@ t , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scr@@ ot@@ um .
L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , lam@@ b takes two steps , fall@@ s down , gets up , sha@@ kes a little , takes another couple steps , fall@@ s down .
I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lam@@ b , at all .
G@@ ets up , wal@@ ks to the corner , it &apos;s qui@@ vering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distr@@ ess .
And I &apos;m looking at the lam@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Al@@ bert , how long ?
When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
Me@@ an@@ while , the lam@@ b that he had just did his little proced@@ ure on is , you know , he &apos;s just pr@@ ancing around , ble@@ eding stopped .
He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ b@@ bling on some gr@@ ass , fro@@ lic@@ king .
And I was just so blo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second .
And I was remin@@ ded how u@@ tter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time .
( Laughter ) And I was especially remin@@ ded of what an ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously short str@@ a@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ bert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lam@@ bs in the p@@ en , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a Ger@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) M@@ el@@ ani@@ e pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b , puts it on the pos@@ t , open@@ s it up .
Al@@ bert hands me the k@@ ni@@ fe .
I go in , tail comes off .
I go in , I gra@@ b the scr@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ p comes off .
Al@@ bert instruc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; P@@ ush it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
&quot; P@@ ush it further . &quot;
I do .
The t@@ es@@ tic@@ les emer@@ ge — they look like th@@ u@@ mb@@ s , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; Bi@@ te &apos; em .
Just bi@@ te &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , and all I can think of is the Ari@@ st@@ ot@@ eli@@ an definition of a trag@@ edy .
You know , Ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le says a trag@@ edy is that moment when the h@@ ero comes face to face with his true identity .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this j@@ ack@@ ed@@ -up metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
I went in and I took them .
I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back .
And I &apos;m standing there with two t@@ es@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t sha@@ ke the metaphor .
OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in Ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of no@@ where , two terms come cr@@ ash@@ ing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my clas@@ sic@@ s prof@@ essor in college dri@@ lled them there .
And they are an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the Gre@@ ek word for discovery .
L@@ iter@@ ally , the transi@@ tion from ignor@@ ance to knowledge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is .
It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my nec@@ k in an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ es every single day .
Great .
The other word , peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great trag@@ edi@@ es , you know — E@@ uri@@ pi@@ des and S@@ op@@ ho@@ cles — the moment where O@@ edi@@ pus has his moment , where he suddenly realiz@@ es that hot ch@@ ick he &apos;s been sle@@ eping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
That &apos;s peri@@ pe@@ ty or peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
And this metaphor in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
When you start to look for peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a , you find it everywhere .
I mean , B@@ ru@@ ce W@@ ill@@ is in &quot; &quot; The Si@@ x@@ th S@@ ense , &quot; &quot; right ?
S@@ pen@@ ds the whole movie trying to help the little kid who se@@ es dead people , and then , bo@@ om — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a .
You know ?
It &apos;s cr@@ ush@@ ing when the audience se@@ es it the right way .
N@@ eo in &quot; &quot; The Ma@@ tri@@ x , &quot; &quot; you know ?
&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
These disco@@ veri@@ es that lead to sudden realiz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dir@@ ty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one dri@@ lled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lam@@ b that I had just de@@ fil@@ ed — but it looked OK .
Lo@@ o@@ king at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struc@@ k by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other peri@@ pat@@ e@@ tic mis@@ concep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment upon ?
Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ thro@@ po@@ logist but I have a friend who is .
And I talk to him .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mi@@ ke .
Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in fish@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
You &apos;ve had your back shoul@@ der to shoul@@ der with these guys that our politicians are desper@@ ate to rel@@ ate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ il@@ lar@@ y doing the sh@@ ots of r@@ ye , dri@@ b@@ bling down her ch@@ in , with the steel workers .
I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , coll@@ ectively , it might be time to think about it .
Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , t@@ es@@ tic@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thoughts are bo@@ un@@ c@@ ing around .
And , after that sho@@ ot , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , person@@ ally .
And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it .
I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other no@@ tions of work that I &apos;ve just been assu@@ ming are sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t , and they &apos;re not .
People with dir@@ ty jobs are happi@@ er than you think .
As a group , they &apos;re the happi@@ est people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ ist@@ ling &quot; &quot; Look for the Uni@@ on L@@ ab@@ el , &quot; &quot; and all that happy wor@@ ker cra@@ p .
I &apos;m just telling you that these are bal@@ anced people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
Ro@@ ad@@ kill pic@@ k@@ er-@@ up@@ pers wh@@ ist@@ le while they work . I swe@@ ar to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sym@@ metry to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challen@@ ged some of these sac@@ red co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
Probab@@ ly the worst adv@@ ice I ever got .
( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bo@@ b Com@@ bs , the pi@@ g farm@@ er in Las V@@ eg@@ as who coll@@ ects the un@@ e@@ aten scr@@ aps of food from the cas@@ inos and feed@@ s them them to his sw@@ ine .
Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pi@@ gs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pi@@ g farm@@ er , and he is good for the environment , and he spen@@ ds his days doing this incredible service , and he sm@@ el@@ ls like hell , but God bl@@ ess him .
He &apos;s making a great living .
You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d lau@@ gh at you .
The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offer@@ ed like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of V@@ eg@@ as .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He st@@ ep@@ ped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
Mat@@ t Fro@@ ind , a da@@ ir@@ y farm@@ er in New Can@@ a@@ an , Con@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut , who wo@@ ke up one day and realized the cra@@ p from his co@@ ws was worth more than their mil@@ k , if he could use it to make these bio@@ degrad@@ able flo@@ wer po@@ ts .
Now , he &apos;s selling them to Wal@@ mar@@ t .
F@@ ol@@ low his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
So I started to look at passion , I started to look at effici@@ ency versus eff@@ ectiv@@ eness — as Ti@@ m talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge dist@@ inc@@ tion .
I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and determin@@ ation , and basically all those pl@@ ati@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; success@@ ories &quot; &quot; that han@@ g with that sch@@ mal@@ t@@ z@@ y art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms around the world right now .
That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
S@@ af@@ ety — safety first ?
Go@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the Hu@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?
I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the B@@ ering Se@@ a , I was on a cra@@ b boat with the &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ li@@ est C@@ atch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ ason .
We &apos;re about 100 miles off the co@@ ast of Rus@@ sia : 5@@ 0-@@ foot se@@ as , big waves , green water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?
Most ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , l@@ ash@@ ing the po@@ ts down .
So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the dec@@ k , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
Un@@ spe@@ ak@@ ably dangerous .
I s@@ cam@@ per down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ du@@ li@@ ty , &quot; Cap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? Oc@@ ean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repe@@ ated in the lower 4@@ 8 .
It can &apos;t be repe@@ ated on any factory floor or any construction site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cra@@ b boat .
My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
And for the rest of that day , safety first .
I was like — So , the idea that we create this fal@@ se — this sense of compl@@ ac@@ ency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and v@@ ice ver@@ sa .
Any@@ how , a whole lot of things .
I could talk at leng@@ th about the many little dist@@ inc@@ tions we made and the end@@ less list of ways that I got it wrong .
But , what it all comes down to is this .
I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my rema@@ ining two minutes and 30 seconds .
It goes like this — we &apos;ve declar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , really .
We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he in some M@@ achi@@ av@@ elli@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it .
And we &apos;ve w@@ aged this war on at least four fron@@ ts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we por@@ tr@@ ay working people on TV — it &apos;s lau@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
If there &apos;s a plu@@ mber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant bu@@ t@@ t cr@@ ack . Ad@@ mit it .
You see him all the time .
That &apos;s what plu@@ mb@@ ers look like , right ?
We turn them into hero@@ es , or we turn them into pun@@ ch lines .
That &apos;s what TV does .
We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at .
But , we &apos;ve w@@ aged this war on M@@ adi@@ son A@@ ven@@ ue .
I mean , so many of the commer@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could reti@@ re a little faster , if you could pun@@ ch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
And right here guys , Si@@ licon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re plu@@ g@@ ged in ; we &apos;re connected .
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
Good gri@@ ef , not to this crow@@ d .
( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imit@@ ation is a complete waste of time .
And nobody celebr@@ ates imit@@ ation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
Your iPhone without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same circu@@ i@@ try , the same board , over and over ?
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the geni@@ us that goes inside of it .
So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ box , you know .
Our tools today don &apos;t look like sho@@ vel@@ s and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the collective effect of all of that has been this mar@@ gin@@ alization of lots and lots of jobs .
And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the t@@ es@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
I got a lot wrong .
So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , man@@ ual labor , sk@@ il@@ led labor .
Some@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ gotten benefits .
I &apos;m talking about grand@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
Bar@@ ack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
The infrastructure is a huge deal .
This war on work , that I sup@@ pose exists , has cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties like any other war .
The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; dec@@ lin@@ ing trad@@ e-@@ school en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ments are the second one .
Every single year : fe@@ wer electri@@ ci@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers , fe@@ wer plu@@ mb@@ ers , fe@@ wer wel@@ ders , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters .
The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in dec@@ line , over and over .
Me@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a mini@@ mum , ac@@ cording to the American So@@ ci@@ ety of Ci@@ vil En@@ gin@@ e@@ ers — that we need to expen@@ d to even make a d@@ ent in the infrastructure , which is currently r@@ ated at a D min@@ us .
So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
And I know the point of this conference is to celebr@@ ate things that are near and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that clean and dir@@ ty aren &apos;t op@@ pos@@ it@@ es .
They &apos;re two sides of the same co@@ in , just like innovation and imit@@ ation , like risk and responsibility , like peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that poor little lam@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ vering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?

My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dor@@ man@@ t inside us .
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of sle@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Tw@@ o-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years ago , I f@@ ain@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion .
I hit my head on my des@@ k . I broke my che@@ e@@ k@@ bone , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right eye .
And I began the journey of re@@ disco@@ vering the value of sleep .
And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough sleep .
( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new femin@@ ist issue .
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep de@@ priv@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ li@@ ty sym@@ bol .
I was recently having dinner with a guy who br@@ ag@@ ged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep de@@ priv@@ ation one-@@ up@@ man@@ ship .
Es@@ peci@@ ally here in Washington , if you try to make a break@@ fast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly bus@@ y and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in fin@@ ance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the ess@@ ence of leadership is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ berg before it h@@ its the Tit@@ anic .
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ itting our Tit@@ an@@ ics .
In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around .
( Applause ) Whi@@ le all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the ic@@ e@@ berg , because she would have wo@@ ken up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ ght-@@ hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
So as we are facing all the multiple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , grati@@ tu@@ de , eff@@ ectiv@@ eness in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
So I ur@@ ge you to shu@@ t your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shu@@ t your engin@@ es and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the func@@ tions and structure of the human brain .
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this ent@@ ails .
Here is this mass of j@@ el@@ ly , three-@@ po@@ und mass of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the pal@@ m of your hand , and it can cont@@ empl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space .
It can cont@@ empl@@ ate the meaning of infin@@ ity and it can cont@@ empl@@ ate itself cont@@ empl@@ ating on the meaning of infin@@ ity .
And this p@@ ecu@@ liar recur@@ sive quality that we call self-@@ awar@@ eness , which I think is the ho@@ ly gr@@ ail of neuro@@ science , of neuro@@ logy , and hopefully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
OK , so how do you study this myst@@ eri@@ ous or@@ gan ?
I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wis@@ ps of proto@@ plas@@ m , interac@@ ting with each other , and from this activity emerg@@ es the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How does this happen ?
Well , there are many ways of appro@@ aching the func@@ tions of the human brain .
One approach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at patients with sustain@@ ed damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s-@@ the@@ -@@ board reduc@@ tion in all your mental capaci@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cognitive ability .
What you get is a highly sel@@ ective loss of one function , with other func@@ tions being preser@@ ved int@@ act , and this gives you some confid@@ ence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in medi@@ ating that function .
So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circu@@ i@@ try &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king examples of this .
In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
The first example is an extraordinary syn@@ dro@@ me called Cap@@ gr@@ as syn@@ dro@@ me .
If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the tempor@@ al lob@@ es , fron@@ tal lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , OK — the lob@@ es that constitu@@ te the brain .
And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the inner surface of the tempor@@ al lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s dam@@ aged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mir@@ ror .
I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mir@@ ror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
OK . Now that syn@@ dro@@ me is well known as caused by damage to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
But there &apos;s another rare syn@@ dro@@ me , so rare , in fact , that very few physici@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logists .
This is called the Cap@@ gr@@ as del@@ u@@ sion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head inj@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor .
She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lu@@ ci@@ d and intelligent in all other resp@@ ects , but when he se@@ es his mother , his del@@ u@@ sion k@@ icks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
Now , the most common interpret@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ chi@@ a@@ try tex@@ t@@ books , is a Fre@@ udi@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same argument appli@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual at@@ tr@@ action to your mother .
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ edi@@ pus complex of Fre@@ ud .
I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Fre@@ udi@@ an view .
And then , as you grow up , the cortex develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ bits these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges towards your mother .
Thank God , or you would all be sex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother .
And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , dam@@ aging the cortex , allo@@ wing these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fl@@ aming to the surface , and suddenly and in@@ explic@@ ably you find yourself being sex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sex@@ ually turned on ?
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpret@@ ation that makes sense to your dam@@ aged brain .
This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
It &apos;s very ingeni@@ ous , as all Fre@@ udi@@ an argu@@ ments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same del@@ u@@ sion , a patient having the same del@@ u@@ sion , about his pet po@@ o@@ dle . ( Laughter )
He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not Fi@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like Fi@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
Now , you try using the Fre@@ udi@@ an explan@@ ation there .
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the lat@@ ent b@@ esti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course .
Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
So , to explain this curious dis@@ order , we look at the structure and func@@ tions of the normal visual path@@ ways in the brain .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , visual signals come in , into the ey@@ e@@ b@@ alls , go to the visual areas in the brain .
There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you percei@@ ve faces .
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
I talked about that earlier .
Now , when that area &apos;s dam@@ aged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
But from that area , the message cas@@ c@@ ades into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , g@@ au@@ ges the emotional signific@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it pre@@ y ? Is it pre@@ dat@@ or ? Is it mate ?
Or is it something absolutely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?
Which you can completely ignor@@ e .
So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is excited , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then cas@@ ca@@ de into the auton@@ o@@ mic nervous system .
Your heart starts be@@ ating faster .
You start swe@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cular ex@@ er@@ tion .
And that &apos;s fortun@@ ate , because we can put two electro@@ des on your pal@@ m and measure the change in skin resist@@ ance produced by swe@@ ating .
So I can determin@@ e , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , OK ?
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s proc@@ essed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you recognize it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
And then the message cas@@ c@@ ades into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , and then goes down the auton@@ o@@ mic nervous system .
But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that wi@@ re that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
So because the fu@@ si@@ form is int@@ act , the cha@@ p can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wi@@ re is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this in@@ explic@@ able lack of emotions ?
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your gal@@ v@@ anic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you swe@@ at when you see an object , like a table or an u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la . Of course , you don &apos;t swe@@ at .
If I show you a picture of a li@@ on , or a ti@@ ger , or a pin@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?
And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start swe@@ ating .
You don &apos;t even have to be Je@@ wish .
( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his gal@@ v@@ anic skin response .
T@@ ables and cha@@ irs and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ anic skin response is fl@@ at .
There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wi@@ re going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll lau@@ gh , he &apos;ll cr@@ y , so on and so forth — but the wi@@ re from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this del@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor .
It &apos;s a lo@@ v@@ ely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , seem@@ ingly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , neur@@ al psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tric syn@@ dro@@ me and say that the standard Fre@@ udi@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a preci@@ se explan@@ ation in terms of the known neur@@ al an@@ ato@@ my of the brain .
By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — phones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no del@@ u@@ sion through the phone .
Then , she appro@@ aches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
The reason is there &apos;s a separate path@@ way going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he recogni@@ zes his mother , no problem .
When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor .
OK , how is all this complex circu@@ i@@ try set up in the brain ?
Is it nature , genes , or is it nur@@ ture ?
And we approach this problem by consider@@ ing another curious syn@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
When an arm is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , or a leg is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , for gan@@ gr@@ ene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vivi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom arm or a ph@@ an@@ tom leg .
In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body .
B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with intern@@ al vis@@ cera .
I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ moved — hy@@ ster@@ ec@@ to@@ my — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , including ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ stru@@ al cr@@ am@@ ps at the appropri@@ ate time of the month .
And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ MS ? &quot;
( Laughter ) A subject ri@@ pe for scientific en@@ qui@@ ry , but we haven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that .
OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom li@@ mb@@ s by doing experiments ?
One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom li@@ mb@@ s claim that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom .
It &apos;ll p@@ at his brother on the shoul@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wave go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
These are very comp@@ el@@ ling , vivi@@ d sens@@ ations .
The patient &apos;s not del@@ u@@ sional .
He knows that the arm is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , it &apos;s a comp@@ el@@ ling sens@@ ory experience for the patient .
But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is paral@@ y@@ zed .
It &apos;s fi@@ xed in a cl@@ en@@ ched s@@ pas@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ at@@ ingly pain@@ ful .
If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be paral@@ y@@ zed ?
It sounds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
But when we were looking at the case she@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the paral@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom li@@ mb@@ s , the original arm was paral@@ y@@ zed because of the peri@@ ph@@ eral ner@@ ve inj@@ ury .
The actual ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the arm was se@@ vered , was cut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ cycle accident .
So the patient had an actual arm , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ id@@ ed attemp@@ t to get rid of the pain in the arm , the sur@@ geon am@@ pu@@ t@@ ates the arm , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom arm with the same pa@@ ins , right ?
And this is a serious clinical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become depres@@ sed .
Some of them are driven to suici@@ de , OK ?
So , how do you treat this syn@@ dro@@ me ?
Now , why do you get a paral@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?
When I looked at the case she@@ et , I found that they had an actual arm , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paral@@ y@@ zed , and lying in a s@@ ling for several months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pain then gets car@@ ried over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself .
Why does this happen ?
When the arm was int@@ act , but paral@@ y@@ zed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No .
And this gets wi@@ red into the circu@@ i@@ try of the brain , and we call this learned paral@@ y@@ sis , OK ?
The brain lear@@ ns , because of this He@@ b@@ bi@@ an , associ@@ ative link , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the arm creates a sens@@ ation of a paral@@ y@@ zed arm .
And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated the arm , this learned paral@@ y@@ sis carri@@ es over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , OK ?
Now , how do you help these patients ?
How do you un@@ learn the learned paral@@ y@@ sis , so you can reli@@ eve him of this ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching s@@ pas@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom arm ?
Well , we said , what if you now send the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?
Maybe you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pain , the ph@@ an@@ tom cr@@ am@@ p .
How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
But that costs millions of dollars .
So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding ag@@ encies .
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mir@@ ror box .
You have a car@@ d@@ board box with a mir@@ ror in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first patient , Der@@ ek , came in .
He had his arm am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated 10 years ago .
He had a br@@ achi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the arm was paral@@ y@@ zed , lying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the arm was am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated .
He had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm , ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ at@@ ingly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
It was a paral@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom arm .
So he came there , and I gave him a mir@@ ror like that , in a box , which I call a mir@@ ror box , right ?
And the patient puts his ph@@ an@@ tom left arm , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in s@@ pas@@ m , on the left side of the mir@@ ror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mir@@ ror , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mir@@ ror . And what does he experience ?
He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the refl@@ ection of the normal arm in the mir@@ ror , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ gers , or move your real fin@@ gers while looking in the mir@@ ror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is moving , right ?
That &apos;s obvious , but the ast@@ on@@ ishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again , and the pain , the cl@@ en@@ ching s@@ pas@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mir@@ ror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your refl@@ ection of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gig@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
He knows it &apos;s a mir@@ ror refl@@ ection , but it &apos;s a vivi@@ d sens@@ ory experience .
Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
And my pain is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; OK ?
And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his eyes .
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;
&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
So , he was like a kid in a c@@ and@@ y store .
So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned paral@@ y@@ sis and the critical role of visual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Pri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ eless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of paral@@ y@@ sis that you see in neuro@@ logy , like str@@ o@@ ke , foc@@ al dy@@ st@@ oni@@ as — there may be a learned compon@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple device of using a mir@@ ror .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Der@@ ek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carr@@ ying a mir@@ ror to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Der@@ ek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dis@@ pen@@ se with the mir@@ ror , un@@ learn the paral@@ y@@ sis , and start moving your paral@@ y@@ zed arm , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mir@@ ror box was gone .
( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
It &apos;s dis@@ appeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subj@@ ects , eth@@ ics and all of that ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Der@@ ek , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm and therefore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ bo@@ w pain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ arm pain , all those pa@@ ins are gone away .
But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ gers dan@@ gl@@ ing from the shoul@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and elimin@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ gers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magi@@ ci@@ an .
Now , why does this happen ?
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tremendous sens@@ ory conflict .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ oc@@ ep@@ tion , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
And your motor comm@@ and saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no arm , right ?
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it g@@ ates the signals .
And when the arm dis@@ appe@@ ars , the bon@@ us is , the pain dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died pain flo@@ ating out there , in space .
So , that &apos;s the bon@@ us .
Now , this techni@@ que has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other groups in H@@ el@@ sin@@ k@@ i , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for ph@@ an@@ tom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for str@@ o@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation .
S@@ tro@@ ke you normally think of as damage to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it .
But , it turns out some compon@@ ent of str@@ o@@ ke paral@@ y@@ sis is also learned paral@@ y@@ sis , and maybe that compon@@ ent can be over@@ come using mir@@ r@@ ors .
This has also gone through clinical tri@@ als , helping lots and lots of patients .
OK , let me switch g@@ ears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia .
This was discovered by Franci@@ s Gal@@ ton in the nin@@ et@@ e@@ ent@@ h century .
He was a cou@@ sin of Charles Darwin .
He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colo@@ red .
Fi@@ ve is blue , seven is yellow , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , nine is in@@ digo , OK ?
B@@ ear in mind , these people are completely normal in other resp@@ ects .
Or C shar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke color .
C shar@@ p is blue , F shar@@ p is green , another t@@ one might be yellow , right ?
Why does this happen ?
This is called syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia . Gal@@ ton called it syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the sens@@ es .
In us , all the sens@@ es are dist@@ inct .
These people mu@@ d@@ dle up their sens@@ es .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two asp@@ ects of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
Sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ esia run@@ s in families , so Gal@@ ton said this is a her@@ edi@@ tary basis , a genetic basis .
Secon@@ dly , syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main them@@ e of this lec@@ ture , which is about creativity — syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia is eight times more common among artists , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other creative people than in the general population .
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
OK , what is syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia ? What causes it ?
Well , there are many the@@ ories .
One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
Another theory is they are aci@@ d jun@@ ki@@ es and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?
Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay A@@ rea than in San Di@@ ego .
( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia . All right ?
So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
So we said , there &apos;s some accid@@ ental c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between color and numbers in the brain .
So , every time you see a number , you see a correspon@@ ding color , and that &apos;s why you get syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia .
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cros@@ sed w@@ ir@@ es in some people ?
Rem@@ ember I said it run@@ s in families ?
That gives you the clu@@ e .
And that is , there is an ab@@ normal gene , a mu@@ tation in the gene that causes this ab@@ normal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing .
In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else .
So , every brain region is wi@@ red to every other region , and these are tr@@ im@@ med down to create the character@@ istic mo@@ du@@ lar architecture of the adult brain .
So , if there &apos;s a gene ca@@ using this tr@@ im@@ ming and if that gene mut@@ ates , then you get de@@ fici@@ ent tr@@ im@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain areas .
And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ color syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia .
If it &apos;s between t@@ one and color , you get ton@@ e-@@ color syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia .
So far , so good .
Now , what if this gene is expres@@ sed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cros@@ s-@@ connected ?
Well , think about what artists , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to engage in metap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king seem@@ ingly un@@ related ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and Ju@@ li@@ et is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ li@@ et is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lowing ball of fire ?
I mean , sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
Nor@@ mal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the sun , she &apos;s nur@@ tur@@ ing like the sun .
In@@ st@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks .
Now , if you assu@@ me that this greater c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing and concep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty towards metap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and creativity in people with syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia .
And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common incid@@ ence of syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia among po@@ ets , artists and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts .
OK , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ olog@@ ical view of syn@@ es@@ th@@ esia .
The last demonstr@@ ation — can I take one minute ?
( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all syn@@ es@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it .
Here &apos;s what I call Marti@@ an al@@ pha@@ bet . Just like your al@@ pha@@ bet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
Di@@ f@@ fer@@ ent shapes for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?
Here , you &apos;ve got Marti@@ an al@@ pha@@ bet .
One of them is Ki@@ k@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ ba .
Which one is Ki@@ k@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ ba ?
How many of you think that &apos;s Ki@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba ? R@@ ai@@ se your hands .
Well , it &apos;s one or two mut@@ ants .
( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba , that &apos;s Ki@@ k@@ i ? R@@ ai@@ se your hands .
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of you .
Now , none of you is a Marti@@ an . How did you do that ?
It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cros@@ s-@@ model syn@@ es@@ thetic abstr@@ action , meaning you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p inf@@ lec@@ tion — ki@@ -@@ k@@ i , in your audi@@ tory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Ki@@ k@@ i , mi@@ mics the visual inf@@ lec@@ tion , sudden inf@@ lec@@ tion of that j@@ ag@@ ged shape .
Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is eng@@ aging in a primi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly illu@@ sion , but these phot@@ ons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the audi@@ tory pattern , but the brain is able to extr@@ act the common denomin@@ ator .
It &apos;s a primi@@ tive form of abstr@@ action , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s dam@@ aged , these people lose the ability to engage in B@@ ou@@ ba Ki@@ k@@ i , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that gli@@ t@@ ters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ lic and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
You have to measure its specific grav@@ ity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the metap@@ hor@@ ical meaning .
So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower pri@@ mates .
Some@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the angu@@ lar g@@ y@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cros@@ s@@ roads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human abilities like abstr@@ action , metaphor and creativity .
All of these questions that philosoph@@ ers have been studying for mill@@ en@@ nia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain ima@@ ging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sor@@ ry about that .
( Laughter )
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ tered this ordinary material , fish@@ net , used the same way for cent@@ uries .
Today , I &apos;m using it to create perman@@ ent , bi@@ llo@@ wing , volu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous forms the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged buildings in cities around the world .
I was an un@@ likely person to be doing this .
I never studied sculp@@ ture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was re@@ j@@ ected by all seven .
I went off on my own to become an artist , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was offer@@ ed a F@@ ul@@ bright to India .
Pro@@ mis@@ ing to give exhibi@@ tions of pa@@ int@@ ings , I shi@@ pped my pain@@ ts and arrived in Ma@@ hab@@ ali@@ pur@@ am .
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show arrived — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fish@@ ing village was famous for sculp@@ ture .
So I tried br@@ on@@ ze c@@ asting .
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , watching the fish@@ er@@ men b@@ und@@ le their ne@@ ts into mo@@ unds on the sand .
I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculp@@ ture , a way to make volu@@ me@@ tric form without heavy soli@@ d materials .
My first satis@@ fying sculp@@ ture was made in collabor@@ ation with these fish@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; Wi@@ de Hi@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ ist@@ ed them on po@@ les to photograph .
I discovered their soft sur@@ faces reve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ p@@ ple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
I was m@@ es@@ mer@@ ized .
I continu@@ ed studying cra@@ ft tradi@@ tions and collabor@@ ating with arti@@ s@@ ans , next in Li@@ th@@ u@@ ania with l@@ ace makers .
I li@@ ked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
Re@@ turning to India to work with those fish@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half hand@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — install@@ ed bri@@ ef@@ ly in Mad@@ rid .
Th@@ ou@@ sands of people saw it , and one of them was the urban@@ ist Man@@ ual Sol@@ a-@@ Mor@@ ales who was re@@ designing the wat@@ er@@ front in Por@@ to , Por@@ tu@@ g@@ al .
He asked if I could build this as a perman@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preser@@ ve my art .
Dur@@ able , engine@@ ered , perman@@ ent — those are in op@@ position to idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cr@@ atic , de@@ lic@@ ate and eph@@ em@@ eral .
For two years , I search@@ ed for a fi@@ ber that could survive ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , sal@@ t , air , pollu@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ main soft enough to move flu@@ id@@ ly in the wind .
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
So we raised this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ po@@ und steel ring .
We had to engineer it to move gr@@ ace@@ fully in an average bre@@ e@@ ze and survive in hur@@ ric@@ ane win@@ ds .
But there was no engineering software to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a brilliant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engineer who desig@@ ns sa@@ ils for America &apos;s C@@ up r@@ ac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts named Pe@@ ter H@@ ep@@ p@@ el .
He helped me t@@ ack@@ le the tw@@ in challenges of preci@@ se shape and gent@@ le movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots weren &apos;t going to with@@ stand a hur@@ ric@@ ane .
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fish@@ net factory , learned the vari@@ ables of their machines , and figured out a way to make l@@ ace with them .
There was no language to trans@@ late this ancient , idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cr@@ atic hand@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ ators could produce .
So we had to create one .
Three years and two children later , we raised this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ foot l@@ ace net .
It was hard to believe that what I had imagin@@ ed was now built , perman@@ ent and had lost nothing in transl@@ ation .
( Applause ) This inter@@ section had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I walked underneath it for the first time .
As I watched the wind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ograph@@ y un@@ fold , I felt shel@@ tered and , at the same time , connected to limit@@ less sky .
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of sculp@@ ture in spaces of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
H@@ ist@@ ori@@ c Phi@@ l@@ adel@@ phi@@ a City H@@ all : its pla@@ za , I felt , needed a material for sculp@@ ture that was li@@ ghter than ne@@ tting .
So we experiment@@ ed with tiny ato@@ mi@@ zed water particles to create a dry mi@@ st that is shap@@ ed by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shap@@ ed by people who can interact and move through it without getting w@@ et .
I &apos;m using this sculp@@ ture material to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins above ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ ray of the city &apos;s circul@@ atory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
N@@ ext challenge , the Bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Amer@@ icas in Den@@ ver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western h@@ emis@@ p@@ here and their inter@@ conn@@ ect@@ ed@@ ness in a sculp@@ ture ?
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
I read about the recent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in Chi@@ le and the t@@ sun@@ ami that ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed across the entire Paci@@ fic Oc@@ ean .
It shif@@ ted the Earth &apos;s t@@ ect@@ onic pl@@ ates , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s rot@@ ation and literally shor@@ ten@@ ed the leng@@ th of the day .
So I cont@@ acted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ sun@@ ami , and transl@@ ated it into this .
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1.@@ 26 &quot; &quot; refer@@ s to the number of micro@@ seconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shor@@ ten@@ ed .
I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
I@@ ts shape was too complex now .
So I re@@ placed the metal ar@@ mat@@ ure with a soft , fine m@@ esh of a fi@@ ber 15 times stron@@ ger than steel .
The sculp@@ ture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the f@@ abri@@ c of the city .
There was no software that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex net forms and model them with grav@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adap@@ t these concep@@ ts to Times S@@ qu@@ are or the Hi@@ gh L@@ ine .
This new soft struc@@ tural method en@@ ables me to model these and build these sculp@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers .
They don &apos;t have fun@@ ding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I search@@ ed for beauty in the traditional things , in cra@@ ft forms .
Now I comb@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ tech materials and engineering to create volu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bi@@ llo@@ wing forms the scale of buildings .
My arti@@ stic hori@@ z@@ ons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
An at@@ tor@@ ney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visi@@ ted the local art museum , drag@@ ged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculp@@ ture .
There they were in their business su@@ its , l@@ aying in the gr@@ ass , notic@@ ing the changing patterns of wind b@@ esi@@ de people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the re@@ discovery of wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizon@@ tal ax@@ is .
After pu@@ ber@@ ty , we fall off the map .
She &apos;s a six@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
So when I was a kid ...
this was my team .
First place I started to look was fish markets .
So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
Many people don &apos;t know this but t@@ una are war@@ m@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded .
There are over 3,000 dam@@ s in the state of Con@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut .
The last of the four is a kind of amor@@ ph@@ ous thing .
So what do we do ?
So I guess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
Thank you .
I essentially became an inf@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two h@@ emis@@ ph@@ eres are completely separate from one another .
Ex@@ cu@@ se me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
In@@ forma@@ tion , in the form of energy , stre@@ ams in simul@@ tane@@ ously through all of our sens@@ ory systems and then it explo@@ des into this enormous coll@@ age of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment sm@@ el@@ ls like and ta@@ st@@ es like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
I am an energ@@ y-@@ being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right h@@ emis@@ p@@ here .
And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
My left h@@ emis@@ p@@ here , our left h@@ emis@@ p@@ here , is a very different place .
Our left h@@ emis@@ p@@ here thinks lin@@ early and meth@@ o@@ dic@@ ally .
And our left h@@ emis@@ p@@ here thinks in language .
And all I could det@@ ect was this energy — energy .
And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
And I felt li@@ ghter in my body .
